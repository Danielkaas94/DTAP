### 🔷 **What 1½ Years in a Chaotic Dorm Taught Me** 🔷

**What do you do when your home stops feeling like a safe space?**  
For me, that question became painfully real over the last 1½ years.

I stayed in a dorm that challenged me on every level—mentally, emotionally, and even physically.  
Shared kitchens left in chaos. Disrespect for others' space. Loud arguments. Slamming doors.  
At times, it felt like survival mode.

I tried to keep the peace. I tried to be understanding.  
But frustration builds when you're the only one trying.  
Eventually, even I left a few post-it notes and blasted music just to cope. Not proud—but I was human, doing my best in a tough situation.

**Looking back now, the biggest lesson was this:**  
👉 Growth isn’t always peaceful.  
Sometimes it’s loud, messy, and uncomfortable.  
Sometimes growth looks like deciding _enough is enough._

And so I left.

🧘‍♂️ I’ve reclaimed my space.  
🌬️ I can finally breathe deeply again.  
🙏 I’m grateful to God for the strength to get through it—and the clarity to know when to walk away.

To anyone feeling stuck in a toxic or draining environment:  
**You’re not weak for wanting peace. You’re strong for protecting it.**  
Growth doesn’t mean tolerating more. It means choosing better.

Now, I move forward. With lessons learned. And with peace in my heart.

### 🌪️ **From Chaos to Calm** 🌪️

After 1½ years in a dorm where slammed doors, sticky counters, and silent shouting matches were part of the daily soundtrack…  
I’ve finally moved out.

Let’s be real—**it wasn’t just the mess or the noise**, it was the _constant mental tension_.  
Trying to talk things through, only to get shrugged off.  
Trying to be kind, only to feel invisible.

Yeah… it wore me down.

😅 I wasn’t perfect either. I left a few post-it notes.  
🎵 Played my fair share of passive-aggressive music therapy.  
But when you’ve tried everything else… sometimes that’s all you’ve got left.

💭 What I’ve learned is this:  
Even when you’re surrounded by chaos, you still get to choose _who you become inside it_.  
And sometimes the strongest thing you can do is walk away.

So I did.

Today, I breathe easier.  
I sleep better.  
I feel peace again.

And to the ones still stuck in a toxic environment:  
**You don’t have to prove anything by staying.**  
Protecting your peace is not weakness—it’s wisdom.

🌬️ “I made it through. I am healing. I am home.”  
📖 This chapter is closed—and I’m already writing the next one.

### ✂️🗿 Confessions from the Passive-Aggressive Olympics - When Kindness Doesn’t Cut It 🗿✂️

Peace out, post-it wars and constant nonsense. I’ll admit, I joined the passive-aggressive Olympics—frustration does things to a person.  
📝🔥🧹 Here’s to cleaner kitchens and calmer nights ahead. 😴💤

When you’re stuck living in a mess—with zero respect and no one pulling their weight—the frustration builds... 🫥😤😖🤐😬  
Passive-aggressive post-it notes and listening to loud but great music to cope aren’t ideal, but sometimes they feel like the only way to get through when direct conversation only sparks more drama.

I’m human. I did what I could to stay sane in an insane environment. And you know what? The fact that I can look back and reflect on it now—that is growth. 💸📉📈💎

## **Part II: The Dorm Diaries** 🗒️✍🏻📝📜

I leave behind a sea of memories:

- Loved the view, hated the vibes. ✌️🏃‍♂️💨  
- Leaving behind four walls and walking red flags. 🚩🏠  
- A moment of silence for what I endured… 🙄🫢🕊️

Growth is realizing not everyone deserves to share your space. 🌱🛫✨  
Sometimes the trash takes itself out. Other times, you gotta move. 🗑️➡️🚶‍♂️

Good riddance to the human headache next door. 🤬🚪👋  
Dorm from hell: exited stage left. May the next victim survive. 🔥🏃‍♂️💀

Survival mode and shallow breath… No more 🤺⚔️🛡️😮‍💨🫁  
After 1½ years in the nightmare zone… I’m finally out. No more bad vibes, no more toxic neighbors. Peace is priceless. ✌️🔥  
It’s been hell, loud, and exhausting—but I made it out. Good riddance to bad energy. 💀🏃‍♂️✨  
No more fake smiles. No more slamming doors. 1½ years too long in that hellhole—never again. 👋🖕🏚️

Some places don’t just drain your energy—they try to steal your soul. I stayed too long, but now I’m free. 🌘➡️🌞  
I didn’t just move; I reclaimed my peace. 1½ years of lessons, now on to healing. 🌿🕊️  

<br>

1.5 years of noise, tension, and straight-up bad energy. I’m out. Good riddance. ✌️🧹🔥  
Goodbye to the worst neighbors I’ve ever had. No love lost. 🖤🚪🖕  
Hell was a dorm room. Escaped. Survived. Thrived. 👣🔥🏃‍♂️

Dorm from hell: escaped without looking back. Good luck to the next poor soul. 🔥🚪💀  
And just like that, I vanished from the worst place I’ve ever lived. The nightmare continues—for someone else. 🎭👋💣  
Survived the dorm from hell. I’m out. Next victim, you're up. 😵‍💫👣🏚️  
Slipped out like a ghost from the dorm of doom. Hope the walls don't talk. 👻🚶‍♂️🔥  
I did my time. 1½ years in the chaos cell. Paroled at last. May the next inmate find peace. 🧱😵🔓

## 😮‍💨🫁 **Part IV: Breathing and Rebirth** 🫁😮‍💨

### It’s time to breathe again 😮‍💨

Welcome. You’re here now.

Take a moment to settle. Feel your body… and the quiet just beneath the noise.

Whisper to yourself, or think clearly:  
**“I allow myself to let go.”  
“I welcome calm.”  
“I deserve peace.”**

You’ve carried enough. You’ve been through enough. You’re allowed to soften now.

Let your shoulders drop…  
Unclench your jaw…  
Wiggle your fingers…  
Feel your body resting against the ground or seat.  
You are safe.

Let’s breathe together now. Nice and slow:

- **Inhale… 1… 2… 3… 4…**  
- **Hold… 2… 3… 4…**  
- **Exhale… 2… 3… 4… 5… 6…**

Again…  

Inhale… feel your chest expand…  
Hold…  
Exhale… let your shoulders melt…

feel your chest expand and your shoulders melt.  
Just a few more rounds. No rush, no force. Just breath.

Keep going at your pace.  
Just a few more rounds.  
No rush. No force. Just breath.  

When you’re ready, let your breath return to normal.  
Bring to mind one small thing you’re grateful for.
It could be:  
**“I made it out.”  
“I’m starting fresh.”  
“The air feels easier now.”**  
Whatever comes—hold it softly for a moment.

Say this to yourself:  
**“I made it through. I am healing. I am home.”**

Gently open your eyes.  
Stretch if that feels good.  
Maybe smile, even just a little. 😶🤨😑🙂☺️ 

**Your breath is your anchor. And it’s always with you.**

## 🐦‍⬛🌃 **Part V: The Raven’s Warning** 🌃🐦‍⬛

The clock struck midnight 🕛  
And through my sleeping 😴💤  
I heard a tapping at my door 🚪  
I looked but nothing lay in the darkness 👀  
And so I turned inside once more

To my amazement 🫢😲  
There stood a raven 🐦‍⬛  
Whose shadow hung above my door  
Then through the silence 🤫  
It spoke the one word  
That I shall hear for evermore ♾️ 

Nevermore  
Thus quoth the raven, nevermore

And still the raven remains in my room  
No matter how much I implore  
No words can soothe him  
No prayer remove him 🙏🛐🥺  
And I must hear for evermore ♾️

Quoth the raven, nevermore  
Nevermore  
Thus quoth the raven, nevermore

### ~ Alan Parson - The Raven 🐦‍⬛

To anyone who’s ever felt trapped by their environment: know that every breath is a step toward a better tomorrow.
