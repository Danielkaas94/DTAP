*(From the medical medium, *The Truth about Illness and How to Heal Yourself* - Anthony William)*

### **I am a word - Compassion**

I reside at God's fingertip. It is the word that is closest to God.  
A word is a source of energy. Certain words hold great power.  
God sends light into words like me and supplies us with the breath of life.  
I am more than a word.

**"Are there others like you?"**  
Yes, faith, hope, joy, peace, and more. They are all living words, but I am higher than them all because I am closest to God. Words like joy and peace are not alone in the heart. They require *compassion* to be complete.

**"Why can't peace be enough by itself?"**

Compassion is the understanding of suffering, answers the Spirit.  
There is no peace, joy, or hope until those who suffer are understood.  
Compassion is the soul of these words. Without it, they are empty.  
Compassion fills them with truth, honor, and purpose.  
I am compassion, and none are above me except God.

**"What, then, is God?"**

God is a word. God is love that is above all other words.  
God is also more than a word.  
God loves everything. God is the greatest source of existence.

People can love, but people do not love everyone unconditionally.  
God does!!!
