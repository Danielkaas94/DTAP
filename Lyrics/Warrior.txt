I'm leaving to search for something new
Leaving everything I ever knew
A hundred years in the sunshine
Hasn't taught me all there is to know

The valley, we will gather there
Helpless in our surrender
Tomorrow the plough becomes the sword
Make us stronger in our danger

Time will pass away
Time will guard our secret
I'll return again
To fight another day

I'll have to be a warrior
A slave I could have been
A soldier and a conqueror
Fighting to be free

I'll have to be a warrior
A slave I could have been
A soldier and a conqueror
Fighting to be free

I'll have to be a warrior
A slave I could have been
A soldier and a conqueror
Fighting to be free

I'll have to be a warrior
A slave I could have been
A soldier and a conqueror
Fighting to be free
