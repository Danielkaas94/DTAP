I had a little look for a minute today
And I told there was something
That I wanted to say

Just sitting here glowing with her red light on
So I've gotta move fast
And it shouldn't take long

Maybe she will, maybe she won't
We can get it so together
If she doesn't say don't

I've never ever thought I was looking for a wife
But I think I could love her
For the rest of my life yeah

I only took one 'cause I couldn't take two
I wanna make love
And it's gotta be you

Every little thing that I ever tried to say
Is coming out right
In my own kinda way

Take it, make it, it really feels fine
She must be Lady Luck
If she's gonna be mine

I never ever thought I was looking for a wife
But I think I could love her
For the rest of my life
I will love you all my life
[repeat last line to fade]
