Cold winds and cloudy skies
Turn to sweetness in her eyes
Fantasies, I realized
Came to life to my surprise

Rain came and took her away
Just when I thought she was here to stay
Sun gone, I was left high and dry
Love came by and touched me
And kissed me so long

Shine hard October moon
Eagle take me to her soon
Run swiftly silver stream
Find my love or let me dream

Now half of me is all of her
I'd be much happier if I were whole
All my words and wisdom fall
The poet's justice leads me to my goal
Leads me to my goal

Cold winds and cloudy skies
Turn to sweetness in her eyes
Fantasies, I realized
Came to life to my surprise
