We barely remember
Who or what came before this precious moment
We are choosing to be here, right now
Hold on, stay inside

This holy reality
This holy experience
Choosing to be here in

This body, this body holding me
Be my reminder here that I am not alone in
This body, this body holding me
Feeling eternal, all this pain is an illusion

Alive

In this holy reality
In this holy experience
Choosing to be here in

This body, this body holding me
Be my reminder here that I am not alone in
This body, this body holding me
Feeling eternal, all this pain is an illusion

Twirling 'round with this familiar parable
Spinning, weaving 'round each new experience
Recognize this as a holy gift and
Celebrate this chance to be
Alive and breathing
A chance to be
Alive and breathing

This body holding me
Reminds me of my own mortality
Embrace this moment, remember
We are eternal, all this pain is an illusion
