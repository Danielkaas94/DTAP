Who's gonna teach you how to dance?
Who's gonna show you how to fly?
Who's gonna call you on the lame dope smoking
Slacking little sucker you are?

Who's gonna get you from behind?
Who's gonna ring your little bell?
Who's gonna con you into buying a television set revolution they sell?
When are you gonna blow the game?
When are you gonna blow the screen?
When will you tell them that the crap doesn't last
And you found a way to make your own dreams
The crap doesn't last and you found a way to make yourself scream
Well I died a million times
And I picked my culture well
And I built myself a gate
They can all now go to hell

I'm never gonna work another day in my life
The gods told me to relax
They said I'm gonna be fixed up right
I'm never gonna work another day in my life
I'm way too busy power tripping
But I'm gonna shed you some light
Get down!

Who's gonna teach you how to dance?
Who's gonna show you how to fly?
When you get tired of the crap baby move over here and maybe buy some of mine

I'm never gonna work another day in my life
The gods told me to relax
They said I'm gonna be fixed up right
I'm never gonna work another day in my life
I'm way too busy power tripping
But I'm gonna shed you some light
Now I'm never gonna work another day in my life
The gods told me to relax
They said I'm gonna be fixed up right
Now I'm never gonna work another day in my life
I'm way too busy power tripping
But I'm gonna shed you some light
