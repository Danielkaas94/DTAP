Sometimes we only live for the here and now
Sometimes we're lonely
Sometimes we feel we need a place to be grounded
Or fly away again

I will fly away again
Oh, I will fly away again

I feel rain pourin' down
I wait to rot away
Live again
Here forever
The spiral never end
Never end

Why are we feeling something's familiar around us?
Are we just dreaming?
Always we search for the answers, but nothing is found
We fly away again

I will fly away again
Oh, I will fly away again

I feel rain pourin' down
I wait to rot away
Live again
Here forever
The spiral never ends

Rot away
Live again
Here forever
The spiral never end

I feel rain pourin' down
I wait to rot away
Live again
Here forever
The spiral never ends

Rot away
Live again
Here forever
The spiral never end
(End)

I will fly away again
Oh, I will fly away again
Oh, I will fly away again
Oh, I will fly away again
