Hello again
I still try to remember how this all began
You can't undo
It's okay though because I've got a gift for you

Poison in the well - I've got a gift for you
A special place in hell - I've got a gift for you
the perfect place to dwell - I've got a gift for you
and though they're not as nice as the ones you gave to me, I hope that they will do

Hello again
I still can't remember how this all began
One thing left to do
So I'm here now and I've got a gift for you

Poison in the well - I've got a gift for you
A special place in hell - I've got a gift for you
the perfect place to dwell - I've got a gift for you
and though they're not as nice as the ones you gave to me, I hope that they will do

Sickness for the skin - I've got a gift for you
a cancer for within - I've got a gift for you
an ending to begin - I've got a gift for you
and though they're not as nice as the ones you gave to me, I hope that they will do
