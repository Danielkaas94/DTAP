I am still here waiting
I'm anticipating
While they are orchestrating
To grant the wish that I am making

No price too great, no distance too far
If I can wish upon a Blackstar
It makes no difference where they are
They'll grant my wish upon a Blackstar

We are all here waiting
We're anticipating
While they are orchestrating
To grant the wishes we are making

It makes no difference who we are
It makes no difference who we are

No price too great, no distance too far
If we could wish upon a Blackstar
It makes no difference who we are
When we have wished upon a Blackstar
When we have wished upon a Blackstar
They'll grant our wish upon a Blackstar
