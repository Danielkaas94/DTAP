So long as we stay free (the will of the, will of the)

Welcome to the desecration, baby
We built you right up and we'll tear you down
Welcome to the celebration, baby
The judges are jailed, the future is ours

Free your sons and unlock your daughters

We'll throw the baby out with the bathwater
With every second our anger increases

We're gonna smash your nation to pieces

We need a transmutation
One we all can see
We need a revolution
So long as we stay free (the will of the, will of the)

We built you right up and we'll tear you down
Welcome to the celebration, baby
The chances are turning, the future is ours
