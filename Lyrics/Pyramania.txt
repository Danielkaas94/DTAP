There are pyramids in my head
There's one underneath my bed
And my lady's getting cranky
Every possible location
Has a simple explanation
And it isn't hanky-panky

I had read
Somewhere in a book
They improve all your food and your wine, it said
That everything you grow in your garden
Would taste pretty fine, instead
All I ever get is a pain in the neck
And a yap-yap-yap-yap-yap-yap-yap-yap

I've consulted all the sages
I could find in yellow pages
But there aren't many of them
And the Mayan panoramas
On my pyramid pajamas
Haven't helped my little problem

I've been told
Someone in the know
Can be sure that his luck is as good as gold
Money in the bank
And you don't even pay for it, if you fold
A dollar in the shape
Of the pyramid that's printed on the back

It's no lie
You can keep the edge
Of a razor as sharp as an eagle's eye
You can grow a hedge
That is vertically straight over ten feet high
All you really need is a pyramid and just a little luck

La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-ooh
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-ooh

I had read
Somewhere in a book
They improve all your food and wine
And I've been told
Someone in the know can be sure of his good luck
And it's no lie
All you really need is a little bit of pyramidic help
