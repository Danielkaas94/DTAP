Got off a plane to the countryside
I drove to the mountain and a hole in the ground
There was crack on the corner and someone dead
And fire coming out of a monkey's head

Don't get lost in heaven
They got locks on the gate
Don't go over the edge
You'll make a big mistake, yeah

Put me in a cab to suburbia
I just took a line, but I wasn't with you
There was more of it there, when I got back home
But you had left me, you don't know my soul

You're a whore (don't get lost in heaven)
Yeah, you're a who-ore
They got locks on the gate
Don't go over the edge
You'll make a big mistake, yeah

You'll make a big mistake, ah
You'll make a big mistake, ah
You'll make a big mistake, ah
You'll make a big mistake, ah
