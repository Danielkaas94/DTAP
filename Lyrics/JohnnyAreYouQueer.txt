Johnny, what's the deal, boy?
Is your love for real, boy?
When the lights are low, you never hold me close
And I saw you today, boy
Walking with them gay boys
God, you hurt me so, now I gotta know
Johnny, are you queer?

'Cause when I see you dancin' with your friends
I can't help wondering where I stand

I'm so afraid I'll lose you
If I can't seduce you
Is there something wrong? Johnny, come on strong
Oh, why are you so weird, boy?
Johnny, are you queer, boy?
When I make a play, you're pushing me away
Johnny, are you queer?

'Cause when I see you dancin' with your friends
I can't help wondering where I stand

Oh, Johnny you're forsaken the love you could be takin'
I wanna give it to you, but you never come through
Oh, why are you so weird, boy?
Johnny, are you queer, boy?
When you asked for a date, I thought that you were straight
But Johnny, are you queer?

Hey Johnny, are you queer, boy?
Johnny, are you queer, boy?
Hey, Johnny. Johnny are you, you know?
Johnny, are you queer, boy?
Johnny, are you queer, boy?
Johnny, are you queer, boy?
Johnny, are you queer, boy?
Johnny, are you queer, boy?
Johnny
