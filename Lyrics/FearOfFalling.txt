I've been standing here waiting for you
But I don't quite know what I'm gonna do
So I drag my heels and I scratch the dust
And I rub my hands so I can feel my blood

I see the rain clouds forming
The dream is disappearing
And I need it more than you
But you've got the power with you

You told me lies to protect the truth
But you won't admit what you're really gonna do
So you hold me to ransom every chance you can
And you tie me down till I'm a broken man

I see the future fading
The dream is disappearing
And I need it more than you
But you've got the power with you

Your words are out of touch
But they don't help me much
'Cos I fear the fear of falling
You seem to hear no warning
Your words are out of touch
This dream won't come to much
'Cos I fear the fear of falling
Why can't you hear me calling forever calling ooh yeah

You change the rules the colour of your skin
And then slam the door so I can reach in
I've tried so hard to be heard
So you think you know it all
But I'll steal the last word

I've watched the daylight fading
The dream is disappearing
And I need it more than you
But you've got the power with you

Your words are out of touch
But they don't help me much
'Cos I fear the fear of falling
You seem to hear no warning
Your words are out of touch
This dream won't come to much
'Cos I fear the fear of falling
Why can't you hear my warning

Your words are out of touch
This dream wont come to much
'Cos I fear the fear of falling
Don't you hear my warning
Your words are out of touch
This dream won't come to much
'Cos I fear the fear of falling
Can't you hear me calling

The dream is disappearing
'Cos you've got the power with you

So here we are this dream has gone too far
So here we are this dream has gone too far
