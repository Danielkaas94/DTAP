When I close my eyes, I can almost see it
When I take a breath you fill up my lungs
And if my mind works backwards for just a minute
I hold on to you, before the memory's gone

I remember u
You lift my spirit
With you, high is all I'm feeling
Remember how we felt alive

I remember u
You make me stronger
Can't go without it much longer
Remember, remember

I remember u
You lift my spirit
With you, high is all I'm feeling
Remember how we felt alive

I remember u
You make me stronger
Can't go without it much longer
Remember, remember

O-o-o-o-oh, o-o-o-oh (4x)

When I close my eyes I can almost see it
When I take a breath you fill up my lungs
And if my mind works backwards for just a minute
I'm all over you, before the memory's gone

I remember u
You lift my spirit
With you, high is all I'm feeling
Remember how we felt alive

I remember u
You make me stronger
Can't go without end much longer
Remember, remember

I remember u
You lift my spirit
With you, high is all I'm feeling
Remember how we felt alive

I remember u
You make me stronger
Can't go without it much longer
Remember, remember
