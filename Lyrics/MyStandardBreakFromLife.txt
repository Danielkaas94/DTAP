I've got a regular problem
So my standard break from life is in order
I'm having trouble making sentences
I'm older, but I don't feel any smarter

You see, I don't know what I said to you
And now you're pissed at, you know who
And I guess, I deserve it
I wish I could waste my time without wasting all your time

I try to leave a good impression
But it's hard when my obsession's in a pint glass
And when you're only 23
It's not attractive to complain about your sore back

Yes, I can bitch until my eyes are blue
And you're in bed with someone new
And I guess, you deserve him
Wish, I could waste my time without wasting all your time

You say I'm fixable
A classic case, lack of will
I say, I don't wanna try
I'd rather stay here all night

I've got a motivation problem
So my standard break from life is getting longer
Spent over 30 hours in this bed
In two days, I guess, I could've phoned her

But now that I'm awake
I'd rather take a drink and walk down to the lake
And beg the sky for lightning bolts
I can't waste my time without wasting all your time

You say it's fixable
A classic case, lack of will
I say, I don't wanna try
I'd rather sit here all night
