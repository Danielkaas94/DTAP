This might be the beginning or the end of things, I'm not sure
And I feel like I don't know what the truth is anymore...
Do you?
I do know that we've been lied to and manipulated for too long
Far far too long
I'm sick and tired of it
Goddammit!

We hide in our homes
Scrolling through feeds and other people's fantasy, made-up lives
While the algorithms give us bite-size information tailored to what
Corporations, lying politicians
And foreign powers want us to see and believe
We've blindly clicked accept to their terms and conditions too
Too many times

And now wе are owned
We'vе been reduced to nothing more than data to be bought and sold
To the highest bidder so they could sell us more crap we don't need
Make us angry at things we never cared about
We've turned into consumption machines
Destroying each other, and the only plan that we have

Whatever happens to our human dignity and privacy?
We thought we had escaped into our own quiet little world
But no!
No!

They had to invade our minds
They wanna control and manipulate the entire reality
But I had to wonder who are they?
Is there even a "they" anymore?
Maybe the algorithms and AI had become the new "they"
And maybe they now control us and manipulate us
When they know us better than we
Know ourselves, we have to wake up

It's time to wake up
Wake up, people!
Wake up, don't you sit there watching
Do something!
This is our last chance to take back control before it's too late
