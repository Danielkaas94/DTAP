Nobody move, there's blood on the floor
And I can't find my heart
Where did it go? Did I leave it in the cold?
So please give it back, 'cause it's not yours to take

It must have fell when I lost my mind
Deep in the cut, drowning in its pain
Somebody help 'cause I can't find my way
Nobody move, nobody move

Somebody tell me how I'm supposed to feel
When I'm sitting here, knowing this ain't real
Why in the world would I give my heart to you?
Just to watch you throw it in the trash

I've been traveling so long, I don't think I can hold on
Where were you when I needed you the most?
Now I'm sitting here with a black hole in my chest
A heartless, broken mess
