Tell me did your pride bleed
When you see me succeed?
Is that the gist of your story?
Now you best get used to it
'Cause I ain't about to quit
And I'm just now gettin' started

Shame me, claim me or deceive me
You grow sick every time you hear me say, believe me
Every time I get one foot up, you wanna tear it down
You deny me
Deceiver
Every time I get one foot up, you tear it down, knock it down, tear it down
Believer
Deny me

Oh, I feel your hand on my throat
As well as the knife in my back
And the whole time you keep smilin'
What is your reason for this?
Why won't your hate just quit?
Life would be better if you weren't struggling

Shame me, claim me or deceive me
You grow sick every time you hear me say, believe me
Every time I get one foot up, you wanna tear it down
You deny me
Deceiver
And every time I get one foot up, you tear it down, knock it down, tear it down
Believer
Deny me

What's wrong with your world?
Doesn't taste the same as mine?
Are the things the same as mine?
Pain, agony, regret, fear
A strange mystery, take it away

Somehow did your pride bleed?
Every time that I succeed
Now that you know, I'd keep trying
Can your weak mind adjust
While now that I'm feeling it?

Every time I get one foot up, you wanna tear it down
You deny me
Deceiver
Every time I get one foot up, you tear it down, knock it down, tear it down
Believer
Deny me

Every time I get one foot up, up, up, woah!
You deny me
Deceiver
Every time I get one foot up, you tear it down, knock it down, tear it down
Believer
Deny me
