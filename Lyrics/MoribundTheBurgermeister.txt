Caught the chaos in the market square
I don't know what, I don't know why, but something's wrong down there
Their bodies twistin' and turnin' in a thousand ways
The eyes all rollin' round and round into a distant gaze
Ah, look at that crowd!

Some are jumping up in the air - say
"We're drowning in a torrent of blood!"
Others going down on their knees, seen a saviour come out of the mud
Oh Mother! It's eating out my soul
Destroying law and order, I'm gonna lose control

What can I do to stop this plague, spread by sight alone
Just a glimpse and then a quiver, then they shiver to the bone
Ah, look at them go!

Bunderschaft, you are going daft? Better seal off the castle grounds
"This is Moribund,
The Burgermeister, I'm gonna keep this monster down,
Somebody sent the subversive element; going to chase it out of town."
No-one will tell what all this is about
But I will find out
I will find out
I will find out

This thing's outrageous, I tell you on the level
It's really so contagious must be the work of the devil
You better go now, pick up the pipers, and tell them to play
Seems the music keeps them quiet, there is no other way
Ah, close the doors!

"We've tried potions and waxen dolls,
But none of us could find any cures,"
Mother please,
Is it just a disease, that has them breaking all my laws?
Check if you can disconnect the effect and I'll go after the cause
No-one will tell what all this is about
But I will find out
I will find out
I will find out
Mother, you know your child
I say, I will
I will
