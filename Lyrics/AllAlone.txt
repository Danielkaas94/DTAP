All alone, all alone
All alone, all alone
All alone, all alone
All alone, all alone

All alone, all alone
All alone, all alone
All alone, all alone
All alone, all alone

All alone, all alone
All alone, all alone
All alone, all alone
All alone, all alone

Leviticus
Deuteronomy

Snatch a piece of my wonderin'
Distant, far like yonderin'
Skin of my tooth like, seat of my boot like
Fly in my soup like, where's the waitress?

Can't take this, really can't finish this
These airs and all these graces
It's my mistake, I make it
J-dub to the boom now make it

Bounce-wiggle, bounce-wiggle
Shakin' all them bangs out
Chemical cut throats
Bound to blow the brain out

Cut to the brain, this ain't no game
I'll show no shame, I'll birth this blame
I'm twisted Cain, I'll twist again
I'll push the blade as plain as day

Known to what these sayers say
Known to what these doers do
We shoot where who and you-know-where
We's about to take it there

We's about to make it clear
We happy or we lonesome
The long jump, the beat heart
From start to finish

Ten spoons of spinach
The soul and the spillage
The cup that runneth over
Return of the 'O God'

All alone, all alone
All alone, all alone
All alone, all alone
All alone, all alone

All alone, all alone
All alone, all alone

Close your eyes and see
When there ain't no light
All you'll ever be
Come on save the night

Because I don't believe
When the morning comes
It doesn't seem to say
An awful lot to me

All alone, all alone
All alone, all alone
All alone, all alone
All alone, all alone

All alone, all alone
All alone, all alone
