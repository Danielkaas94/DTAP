I feel so strange what's wrong with me
You've got a problem that you can't see
But I've got a feeling all the rumours are true
I see the girl's got a hook in you

You carry on believing
That you can take or leave it
Now who are you deceiving
Cause when its own up time
She's in back of your mind

She's got her hooks in you

You said you'd never let it happen again
You spend your money and you're deeper in
Your fair-weather friends call two by two
To let you know what's wrong with you

But now your heartbeat's thumpin'
You watch your nerve ends jumpin'
Well I can tell you something
When it's own up time
You're gonna toe the line

She's got her hooks in you
She's got her hooks in me too
