I get up at seven, yeah, and I go to work at nine
I got no time for livin', yes, I'm workin' all the time
It seems to me I could live my life
A lot better than I think I am
I guess that's why they call me
They call me the working man

They call me the working man
I guess that's what I am

So I get home at five o'clock and I take myself out a nice, cold beer
Always seem to be wond'rin' why there's nothin' goin' down here

It seems to me I could live my life
A lot better than I think I am
I guess that's why they call me
The working man

Well, they call me the working man
I guess that's what I am

Well, they call me the working man
I guess that's what I am

I get up at seven, yeah, and I go to work at nine
