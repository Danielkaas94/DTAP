The story of my life
Was written there in front of me
The book revealed
The lines upon my face
After chapter one
The images of better times
Turned into a classic cold embrace

Just throw the book away

Through your eyes you'll write again
And the book of lies
Cuts deep into my mind
Did I steal your heart
And leave it in the rain
I'll never know, no I'll never know

It's me I recognise
Or am I getting in too deep
It's getting harder now
To turn the page
Did I read my name
Or is it just coincidence
Only what is true will cure my rage

Coming to the end
Sentences are bitter sweet
Paragraphs that leave me feeling cold
But it's all too late
The written world will always be
The essence of how well
The story's told
