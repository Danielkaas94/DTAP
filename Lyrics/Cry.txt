It’s making you cry every time you give your love to me this way
Saying you’d wait for me to stay, I know it hurts you, 
But I need to tell you something
My heart just can’t be faithful for long
I swear I’ll only make you cry

Maybe I’d change for you someday, but I can’t help the way I feel
Wish I was good, wish that I could give you my love now…
