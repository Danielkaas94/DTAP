We slide in from the epoch of Anglo-American wire
And a Saxon spire
Glint in the glare far above me
Put pressure on it!

She collapse me
Man alive, her every ache a baton to me
Age of ending
Where's the worth in proving I was here?

But maybe Qwerty can leave some little evidence while he lives
They might be lying in rows, they can't believe that it's happening
And Qwerty Finger replies, "I don't know how to sleep knowing this"
I can't go down like the rest, oh, Qwerty take it away (if it's gonna happen to him)

So, how will they remember us whole, when we turn into salt?
And it's mine the fault
Mine the dream and the vein, home of whale flesh
Make soap out of it!

I regret so
Every wand I splinter in a fit of frenzy
Distant memory
She don't care for leaving anything behind

But maybe Qwerty can leave some little evidence while he lives
They might be lying in rows, they can't believe that it's happening
And Qwerty Finger replies, "I don't know how to sleep knowing this"
I can't go down like the rest, oh, Qwerty take it away (then it's gonna happen to him)

I can't let you turn yourself off
Off, hmm

Your every ounce an element sleeping
A part of you just never quite receiving
I wanna be the one to get in
Oh, yeah
But the only way you tell me you're certain
To draw asunder every leper curtain
Would be a hail of every flower to ash
Oh, yeah

When every attosecond means nothing
And all that you believe in isn't working
I can't begin to tell you I know
Oh, yeah
In twenty thousand years they trawl the seaboard
But all that's washing up there is a keyboard
Yeah, they piece it all together from that
Oh, yeah

Come on, child
What you say, what you do, yeah it's all over now
Qwerty Finger no more, ye-eh-eh-eh
Qwerty Finger no more, eh-eh-eh-eh
I can't do what you ask me, eh-eh-eh
Qwerty Finger no more, no more

She collapse me
Man alive, her every ache a baton to me
Age of ending
Where's the worth in proving I was here?
