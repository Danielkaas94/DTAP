Find a way, a way to be
You're looking down again, just let it be
And I'd only do for you, what you'd do for me
And I only would do for you, what you'd do for me

Wastin' time, like it was free
Will you ever find, where you'll be
And I only would do for you what you'd do for me
And I only would do for you what you'd do for me
And I only would do for you what you'd do for me yeah
And I only would do for you what you'd do for me

(Ooh) Don't look back just to lean on me
(Ooh) It's taken the life out of me
(It's not like you'd know) You've never been close enough
Closer than you've been to me (It's not what you say)
It's just in the way (You push me away)

And I'd only do for you what you'd do for me yeah
And I only would do for you what you'd do for me yeah
And I'd only do for you what you'd do for me
And I only would do for you what you'd do for me
