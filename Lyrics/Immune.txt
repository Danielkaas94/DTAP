"We have come here from all over the world
Because society has no futher use for you
This place
Will now be your home and land until the death
It's very good, this place
Because I make all the rules
But if you break any of my rules
You'll find there is' life after death."

Patience is how I'm living today
I lie before you stressing me out again
My life is twisted, twisted like your own brains
I can't accept that, I can't accept that again.

Yeah, face it
No, try it
Yeah, immune to what you are.

A superstition jinxing me like the black cat
Inside you it's only what I crave
A system breakdown
Can you remember your name?
Did you forget you?
Did you forget your identity?

Yeah, face it
No, try it
Yeah, immune to what you are
Yeah. face it
No, try it
Yeah, immune to what you are

Yeah!
Try it!
No, yeah!

What's the matter with your own ways?
What's the matter with your own ways?
Why are you freaking me out again?
No.
What's the matter with your own mind?
What's the matter with your own mind?
You can't be yourself anymore
When your sucking out my life from under me

Yeah, face it
No, try it
Yeah, immune to what you are
Yeah, face it
No, try it
Yeah, immune to what you are

Face it
No, Face it
No, face it
Yeah, try it.
