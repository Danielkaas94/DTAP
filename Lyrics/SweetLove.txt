You're my sweet love
And every time I fall into the beauty of
The endless of
The grey blue of your eyes, I die

You're my sweet love
And every time I kiss the velvet of
Electric of, cinnamon of your lips

You're my sweet love
And every time it's you
The way you move
The way you breathe
The way you look at me
When I get lost in you

And darling when you come
Hanging on a silence thread
Whispering your love
Whispering your grace
And darling when you smile
Closing slowly now your eyes
