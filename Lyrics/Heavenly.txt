Wanting your love to come into me
Feeling it slow, over this dream
Touch me with a kiss, touch me with a kiss

Now you’re above feeling it still
Tell me it’s love, tell me it’s real
Touch me with a kiss, feel me on your lips

Because this is where I want to be
Where it’s so sweet & heavenly

I’m giving you all my love

Needing you now to come into me
Feeling it slow, over this dream
Touch me with a kiss, feel me on your lips

When you’re above feeling it still
Tell me it’s love, tell me it’s real
Touch me with a kiss, touch me with a kiss...

& when you’re far away I still feel it all
& when you’re far away I still feel it all the same...
