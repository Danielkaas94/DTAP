Yeah, I love you so much.
I don't need to resist.
I don't need to exist.
Dripping blue blood from the wrist.
I don't need to resist.
And all the neighbors get pissed when I come home.
I make em nervous. Yeah, I make em nervous.

Crack a window, crack a broken bone.
Crack your knuckles when you're at home.
Lick an ice cream cone. Crack a bone.

All you had to do was ask.
Who is it that wears the mask?
When you give me the task.
Leave me broke and shirtless.
Check your lips at the door woman.
Shake your hips like battleships.

Yeah, all the white girls trip when I sing at Sunday service.
Sing. Sing. Sing.

I only got one face da da da da.
I tried too long to erase.
You know if I left. da da da da.
I wouldn't leave a trace.

If I left you woman, you know, I wouldn't leave a trace.
I wouldn't leave a trace. I wouldn't leave a trace.

If I left, you'd never see me again.
You'd never see me again.
I wouldn't leave a trace.

You'd never see me again.
