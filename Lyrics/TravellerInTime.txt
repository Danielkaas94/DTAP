Every day I have to look to the sun
To see where it was that I have come from
I have a feeling that there must be a time

When I'll get a chance to go home
'Cause I'm so tired of being here alone
But I'm just a traveller in time
Trying so hard to pay for my crime, Oooh

If I could go back the same way I got here
And see the people that I once held so near
I'd do my best to find an answer for you

But first I must wait till I'm set free
And I don't know how long that's gonna be
'Cause I'm a man with a whole lot on his mind
Just out there somewhere traveling in time
Traveling in time

I've tried for so long to find
Some way of helping mankind
