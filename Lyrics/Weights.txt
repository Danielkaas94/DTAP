Tell your friends not to live like they are
With terrible weights
Come with rope to hold up the bridge
Oh, the weights, the tiniest weights grow to
Tell your friends not to live like they are
With terrible weights
Come with rope to hold up the bridge
Oh, the weights, the tiniest weights grow to

Blind by daybreak, splintered, diamond matter
Will you make me lucid, why'd you have to double my weights?
Double the weights, double the
Travel over nothing, boy, I'm telling you it's

Time to live alone, it's time to live alone
You did, oh, but you did what you had to

So come on, coldest exit lurcher, there's a bottle on the fire
Sleep in cinders at the burden of the weights
Double the weights, double the
Heaviest of moments, all together now
It's damn near unconvincing, add the burden, up the weights
Double the weights, double the

Time to live alone, it's time to live alone
You did, oh, but you did what you had to

Friend, don't break the code
A tiny part, a tiny part remains
I know how it starts and now I know
I know how it ends

I know how it ends, I know how it ends
I know how it all ends, I know how it all ends
I know how it ends, I know how it all
I know how it all ends, I know how it ends
I know how it ends, I know how it all ends
I know how it ends, I know how it ends
I know how it all ends, I know how it all ends
I know how it ends, I know how it all
I know how it all ends, I know how it ends
I know how it ends, I know how it all ends
I know how it ends, I know how it ends
I know how it all
