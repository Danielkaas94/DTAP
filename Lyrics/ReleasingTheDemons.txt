What do you see in the dark
When the demons come for you?

If only you could have seen
How fucked up my life used to be
Then everything starts to change
Supposedly healing my pain

I never thought I'd feel this way
I never thought that I'd see a day
I'd run away from anything
Or anywhere or anyone
It's all these demons haunting me
It's all these little things trapped inside of me
Releasing me from all my sin

It's taken me out of my anger
And taken me out of my hate
To learn how my life came together
Releasing the demons again

And now I look through my minds eye
And see where my past needs to rest
It's always disturbed by these voices
That echo inside of my head
Another way that I can hide
Another reason to crawl inside
And get away from everything
And everywhere and everyone
No, it's all these demons haunting me
It's all these little things trapped inside of me
Releasing me from all my sin

It's taken me out of my anger
And taken me out of my hate
To learn how my life came together
Releasing the demons again, again, again

Facin' the days as I grow into my own
Loving and hating's the same
And three-fold I told you, it comes back with laughter
Over and over again, it's coming back

It's taken me out of my anger
And taken me out of my hate
To learn how my life came together
Releasing, releasing the demons again
Releasing the demons again
Releasing the demons again
Releasing the demons again
Releasing the demons
