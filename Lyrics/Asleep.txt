Wait a minute
Can't you see what this pain has done to me
I'm alive, but I'm sleeping
What you see, I cannot see
And maybe you'll think before you speak

I'm alive
For you I'm awake
Because of you I'm alive
I told you I'm awake
Swallowing you

Take a second
Turn your back on me
And make me believe
It's safe to say you're never alive
A big part of you has died
And by the way
I hope you're satisfied

I'm alive
For you I'm awake
Because of you I'm alive
I told you I'm awake
Swallowing you
I'm alive
For you I'm awake
Because of you I'm alive
I told you I'm awake
Swallowing you
