Thought of no tomorrow
The pain, tears and sorrow
And you never told me why
The way you cheated
And mistreated
I could never ask you why

Well, I'm gonna find out
I'm gonna find out
What's been messing up your mind
Messing up your mi-mind

Well, I've been through
Some changes
Now I'm leaving
While my mind rearranges
Why I'm grieving
I don't mean that you hurt me
Or deceived me
For I know that you're there
And you need me
You sure do

But I hope you can't see how it is
I can't stay any longer
I've got to go

Is there any true reason
Or anything I can explain
Can't we talk about it baby
And get together again
You see I have a feeling
That this isn't the end
And I feel knowing
On you I depend
I depend and I hope

I'm gonna find out, yes I am
I'm gonna find out
What it is that's been
Messing up your mind

Well, I said that I love you
And I need you
Then it means I am yours
Yes, I belong to you
But I just can't be certain
That you love me too
Well, I've got to know
If I can believe in you

Please believe my heart is yours
I can't stay any longer
I've got to go

Perhaps it's best for us
To stay together
And try to live our lives as one
And maybe we will find
We're still together
To watch the setting of the sun
Oh-oh, oh-oh
We got it, we got it
We got it
As we did, yeah

Perhaps it's best for us
To stay together
And try to live our lives as one
And maybe we will find
We're still together
To watch the setting of the sun
Oh-oh, oh-oh
We got it, we got it
We got it
As we did, yeah
