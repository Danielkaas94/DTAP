What do you think I am
Do you think I'm dreaming
Don't you know I know
What it is you're scheming

Who d'you think gave you the right
Hidden by the dead of night
To take the world and
Turn it upside down
When it should be round

Seems I made it just in time
To use my reason and my rhyme
To save us from
The evils of your mind

I will cast the spell
Be sure I'll cast it well
I will light a fire
Kindled with desire

I'll fill you with fear
So you know I'm here
And I won't be treated like a fool

It's no good you pretending
There'll be no happy ending
I'm alive and darkness is my tool

But when the night is over
And daytime steals your cover
The goodness of the morning sun
Will warm away
What you have done
And leave you cold

I have no need for moonlight
You're wrong to trust in sunlight
For I exist not just in storms
But in life itself in so many forms
To leave you cold

I will leave you now
But you won't defeat me
You had best beware
When you come to meet me

Love and truth will follow me
An army of reality
Brought from every corner
Of the world

You will never break the spell
I'll summon all the fires of hell
And this is my advice
For what it's worth

Let us not begin
This fight we cannot win
Be sure you're watching me
'Cause all through your life
Everyday and everynight
You should know that
I'll be watching you
