"Welcome home," she said to me
"Let's hide away before they see.
I need so much to be alone with you, I do, I do"
"Come with me," she took my hand
"Please try to help me understand"
So pointless when my heart has turned to stone
"I know, I know"

I wish i didn't need you now
and i wish i didn't need you now
and i wish i didn't need you now
I need you now, i need you now

"I wish we could," she whispered near
"Go someplace far away from here."
While hoping that small voice would
Disappear that said, "welcome to the end"
