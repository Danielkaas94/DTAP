There's a fire forming
Not too far from here
Out on the East Coast
Maybe it resides in you my dear

We're worn out on our courtesy
We've made our curtain calls
Like vampire bats deprived of blood
Into the New York City night we crawl

And you've got a funny way of showing off
Your bathroom surgery
You said you were just cooling down
From plans of leaving me

There's something I should tell you
For we may not have much time
I've never met arms like yours

The stars at night are big and bright
Deep in your eyes, Miss Vincent
You told me once I made you smile
We both know damn well I didn't

I'm not much of a jester
But I'd test poison food for you
Your majesty, you're royal blue
I'm loyalty, your king of pain

There's a hard rain falling
Flooding your attic, it's clear
Can't put out the fire
That resides in you, my dear

There's something I should tell you
For we may not have much time
I've never seen scars like yours

The stars at night are big and bright
Deep in your eyes, Miss Vincent
You told me once I made you smile
We both know damn well I didn't

I'm not much of a jester
But I'd test poison food for you
Your majesty, you're royal blue
I'm loyalty, your king of pain
