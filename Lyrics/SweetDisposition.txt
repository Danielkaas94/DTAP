Sweet disposition, never too soon
Oh, reckless abandon
Like no one's watching you
A moment, a love, a dream aloud
A kiss, a cry, our rights, our wrongs
A moment, a love, a dream aloud
A moment, a love, a dream aloud

So stay there
Cause I'll be coming over
And while our blood's still young
It's so young, it runs
And won't stop till it's over
Won't stop to surrender

Songs of desperation
I played them for you
A moment, a love, a dream aloud
A kiss, a cry, our rights, our wrongs
A moment, a love, a dream aloud
A moment, a love, a dream aloud

So stay there
Cause I'll be coming over
And while our blood's still young
It's so young, it runs
And won't stop till it's over
Won't stop to surrender

Won't stop till it's over
Won't stop to surrender
