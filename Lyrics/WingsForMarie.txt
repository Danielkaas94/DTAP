You believed.
You believed in movements none could see
You believed in me.

A passionate spirit.
Uncompromised
Boundless and open.
A light in your eyes, then, immobilized.

Vacant, broken.
Fell at the hands of
Those movements that I wouldn't see.
'Cause it was you who prayed for me so
What have I done to be a son to an angel?
What have I done to be worthy?

Day light dims leaving cold fluorescence.
Difficult to see you in this light.
Please forgive this selfish question, but
What am I to say to all these ghouls tonight?

She never told a lie.
Well might've told a lie,
But never lived one.
Didn't have a life.
Didn't have a life.
But surely saved one.
Saved one.

See? I'm alright, now
It's time for us to let you go.
