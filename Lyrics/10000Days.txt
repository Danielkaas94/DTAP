We listen to the tales and romanticize,
How we'd follow the path of the hero.

Boast about the day when the rivers overrun,
How we rise to the height of our halo.

Listen to the tales as we all rationalize,
Our way into the arms of the savior.

Feigning all the trials and the tribulations.
None of us have actually been there,
Not like you...

Ignorant siblings in the congregation.
Gather around spewing sympathy,
Spare me...

None of them can even hold a candle up to you.
Blinded by choice, these hypocrites won't see.

But enough about the collective Judas.
Who could deny you were the one who illuminated
Your little piece of the divine?

And this little light of mine, a gift you passed on to me
I'm gonna let it shine
To guide you safely on your way.

Your way home...

Oh, what are they gonna do when the lights go down?
Without you to guide them all to Zion?
What are they gonna do when the rivers overrun
Other than tremble incessantly?

High is the way,
But our eyes are upon the ground.
You are the light and the way.
They'll only read about.
I only pray heaven knows,
When to lift you out.

10,000 days in the fire is long enough.
You're going home...

You're the only one who can hold your head up high.
Shake your fist at the gates saying,
"I've come home now!
Fetch me the spirit, the son and the father.
Tell them their pillar of faith has ascended.

It's time now!
My time now!
Give me my
Give me my wings!"

Give me my [5x]

Give me my wings

You are the light, the way,
That they will only read about.

Set as I am in my ways and my arrogance.
Burden of proof tossed upon the believers.
You were my witness, my eyes, my evidence,
Judith Marie, unconditional one.

Daylight dims leaving cold fluorescence.
Difficult to see you in this light.
Please forgive this bold suggestion.
Should you see your maker's face tonight,
Look him in the eye.
Look him in the eye and tell him,
"I never lived a lie, never took a life,
But surely saved one.

Hallelujah
It's time for you to bring me home."
