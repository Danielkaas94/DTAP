I finally get what you've been saying
Now that we're knee deep side by side
The storm clouds are circling above us
As we struggle against the tide

I feel your grip firm on my shoulder
But this fear in my head won't subside
They patiently circle around us
As we hold out

Oh father, why have they forsaken me?
You warned me that they would
With curses passing down the bloodline
Unspoken and misunderstood

We're losing light
And strength of will
The darkened depths beckoning still
And we hold on against the tide

Beneath the storm and left to fight alone
Remember son, you're reaping what you've sown
Under the waves and sinking like a stone
I'm sorry son, you're reaping what you've sown

Beneath the storm and left to fight alone
Remember son, you're reaping what you've sown
Under the waves and sinking like a stone
I'm sorry son, you're reaping what you've sown

You're reaping what you've sown
You're reaping what you've sown
You're reaping what you've sown
You're reaping what you've sown

We're slowly losing ground
And hope is harder to maintain
When all the prayers we've prayed
Feel lost like tears in the rain

The waters pulling down
The moon's eclipsing the sun
The ending that we knew would come
Has finally begun

You're reaping what you've sown
It's finally begun
You're reaping what you've sown
I'm sorry son, you're reaping what you've sown
You're reaping what you've sown
You're reaping what you've sown

This sorrow weighs down on my shoulders
This fear is getting harder to hide
You'll leave me alone in this darkness
Left to hold out
Against the tide
