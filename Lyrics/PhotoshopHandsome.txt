I will gain an extra life, when I get the high score
(You can respawn anywhere)
I am one with the furniture, more inanimate than amateur
(Like a television set) gangrene knuckle announced so audibly

I will boost my attention span, soon my clock will have a minute hand
(You've become a smithereen) I'm watching that
Foxhound frolic on the abattoir floor, up in heaven it's symmetrical, oh

Airbrush!
What have you done with my father?
Why does he look like a carving?
I don't wanna live in the present
I make my own density

And ah-ah-ah!
Who did your Photoshop handsome?
You ready for reincarnation?
Gotta come back as something organic
Or come back as something else

Just come back as something else!
More dollar! Less scholar! Less time!

My teeth dazzle like an igloo wall, I inhabit, I inhibit y'all
(Can you operate alone?)
Chest pumped elegantly elephantine, southern hemisphere by Calvin Klein
(Watch your dorsal fin collapse) but I know nothing about my history
I put a rainforest in an Oxo cube, struck by lightning if I take the tube
(Thank your chromosomes for that) eh!
I have skin like a waxen peel and a face that I can never feel but

Airbrush!
What have you done with my landscape?
Flooding the fields with this clone shape?
Where is the country you died for?
And what is the century?

And ah-ah-ah!
Who did your Photoshop handsome?
Ready for reincarnation?
Gotta come back as something less frantic
Or banish that army of panic
Or come back as something organic

Just come back as something organic (ga-nic, come back as something organic)
Just come back as something organic (ga-nic, come back as something organic)
Come back as something organic (ga-nic, come back as something organic)
Just come back as something organic (ga-nic, come back as something organic)
Come back as something organic (ga-nic, come back as something, call back)
Or come back as something else

I will gain an extra life
I will gain an extra life (I will gain an extra life)
I will gain an extra life (I will gain an extra life)
I will gain an extra

Airbrush!
What have you done with my father?
Why does he look like a carving?
I don't wanna live in the present
I make my own density

And ah-ah-ah-ah!
Who did your Photoshop handsome?
Ready for reincarnation?
Gotta come back as something organic
Or come back as something else
