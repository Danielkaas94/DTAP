I've got a book of matches
I've got a can of kerosene
I've got some bad ideas
Involving you and me

I don't blame you for walking away
I touched myself, had thoughts of flames
I shat the bed, I laid there in it
Thinking of you, wide awake for days

And I found you tongue-tied
In my twisted little brain
You couldn't crack a smile
I didn't catch your name

I don't blame you for walking away
I'd do the same if I saw me
I swear it's not contagious
In four short steps we can erase this

Step one, slit my throat
Step two, play in my blood
Step three, cover me in bloody sheets
And run laughing out of the house

Step four, stop off at Edgebrook Creek
And rinse your crimson hands
You took me hostage and made your demands
I couldn't meet them so you cut off my fingers, one by one

I'm like a broken record
I've got a needle scratching me
It injects the poisons
Of alcohol IV

I don't blame you for walking away
I'd do the same if I saw me
I swear it's not contagious
Swear to God it's not contagious

Step one, slit my throat
Step two, play in my blood
Step three, cover me in bloody sheets
And run laughing out of the house

Step four, stop at Lake Michigan
And rinse your crimson hands
You took me hostage and made your demands
I couldn't meet them so you cut off my fingers, one by one

This could be love
Love for fire
This could be love
Love for fire
This could be love
For fire, forever more

Step one, slit my throat
Step two, play in my blood
Step three, cover me in bloody sheets
And run laughing out of the house

Step four stop off at Berkeley Marina
And rinse your crimson hands
You took me hostage and made your demands
I couldn't meet them so you cut off my fingers, one by one
