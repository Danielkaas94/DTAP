Na-na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na-na
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na-na

I got a certain little girl, she's on my mind
No doubt about it, she looks so fine
She's the best girl that I ever had
Sometimes she's gonna make me feel so bad

Na-na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na-na
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na-na

Hush, hush
I thought I heard her calling my name now
Hush, hush
She broke my heart, but I love her just the same now
Hush, hush
Thought I heard her calling my name now
Hush, hush
I need her loving and I'm not to blame now

(Love, love) they got it early in the morning
(Love, love) they got it late in the evening
(Love, love) well, I want that, need it
(Love, love) oh, I gotta gotta have it

She's got loving like quicksand
Only took one touch of her hand
To blow my mind and I'm in so deep
That I can't eat and I can't sleep

Na-na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na-na
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na-na

Listen, hush, hush
Thought I heard her calling my name now
Hush, hush
She broke my heart, but I love her just the same now
Hush, hush
Thought I heard her calling my name now
Hush, hush
I need her loving and I'm not to blame now

(Love, love) they got it early in the morning
(Love, love) they got it late in the evening
(Love, love) well, I want that, need it
(Love, love) yeah, I gotta gotta have it

Na-na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na-na
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na-na
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na-na
