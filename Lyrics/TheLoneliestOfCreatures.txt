Sometimes I feel like I'm the loneliest of all creatures in the universe
Oh no! Oh no! Oh no! Oh no!
Oh no you're not the loneliest of all creatures in the universe
Oh no! Oh no!

If I am not the loneliest of creatures
There must be someone lonelier than me
But I can't believe despair could be much deeper
When I'm as lonely as a man can be

Oh no! Oh no! Oh no! Oh no!
Oh no you're not the loneliest of all creatures in the universe!
Oh no! Oh no!

Suppose I'm not the loneliest of creatures
Then tell me who this wretched soul might be
In the dark of night there lives a lighthouse keeper
And the lone survivor of his world is he
The lone survivor of his world
Is he

But I feel like I'm the loneliest of all creatures in the universe
Yet I know I'm not the loneliest of all creatures in the universe
