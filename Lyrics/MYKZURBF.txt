Lucifer, you're landing
Crosshairs on the kitchen sink
Barb wire in the bathroom
I can't make new memories since

Flashbacks to the time
This shell-shocked apartment was the place
I met with your boy
It's a mortal thing, yeah, it's a mortal thing, "Oh!"
He looked at me funny and I, "Oh! Oh!"
Think our secret's out and I, "Oh-ooh-oh!"
I try to explain, but then munitions rain
And we're the epicentre

It's like I'm watching the A4 paper taking over the guillotine
It's like I'm watching the A4 paper taking over the guillotine

(And I wanna know what happened to your boyfriend)
'Cause he was looking at me like, "Whoa!"
(Yeah, right before the kitchen was a dustbowl)
And tossing me the keys and I can't forget how
(And everything just coming through the windows)
And half the street was under my nails
(It's like we're sitting in a Faraday cage)
When the lights all failed

I fly through the walls
All pieces colliding and I
See Raymond apart
He's a-frowning now, wagging a finger at me, "Boy!"
His knees bend the other way and, "Boy! Boy!"
Are you guys together, honey? "B-b-boy!"
Oh, but now I can't find his torso
"Hm, hm, hm" I guess you're separated now

It's like I'm watching the A4 paper taking over the guillotine (Monica, I just wanna know)
It's like I'm watching the A4 paper taking over the guillotine (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)

(And I wanna know what happened to your boyfriend)
'Cause he was looking at me like, "Whoa!"
(Yeah, right before the kitchen was a dustbowl)
And tossing me the keys and I can't forget how
(And everything just coming through the windows)
And half the street was under my nails
(It's like we're sitting in a Faraday cage)
When the lights all failed
The lights all failed

Lucifer, you're landing (I do believe it will be business inside, lights all failed)
Crosshairs on the kitchen sink (it's a real spanner into my works, I think I kicked the bucket)
Baby's on the bullseye (I do believe it will be business inside, lights all failed)
I can't make new memories since (it's a real spanner into my works)
Ries since, ries since

(And I wanna know what happened to your boyfriend)
'Cause he was looking at me like, "Whoa!"
(Yeah, right before the kitchen was a dustbowl)
And tossing me the keys and I can't forget how
(And everything just coming through the windows)
And half the street was under my nails
(It's like we're sitting in a Faraday cage)
When the lights all failed

(And now everybody gotta go hungry)
And everybody cover up their mouths
(And I haven't seen the body count lately)
But looking at your faces, it must have been bad
(And if everybody answered their phone calls)
But people say the army's on fire
(It's like we're sitting with our parachutes on)
But the airport's gone
