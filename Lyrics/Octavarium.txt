I never wanted to become someone like him
So secure content to live each day just like the last
I was sure I knew that this was not for me
And I wanted so much more
Far beyond what I could see
So I swore that I'd
Never be someone like him

So many years have passed
Since I proclaimed my independence
My mission
My aim
And my vision
So secure content to live each day like it's my last
It's wonderful to know that I could be
Something more than what I dreamed
Far beyond what I could see
Still I swear that I'm
Missing out this time

As far as I could tell
There's nothing more I need
But still I ask myself
Could this be everything?
Then all I swore
That I would never be was now
So suddenly
The only thing
I wanted
To become
To be someone just like him

A doctor sitting next to me
He asks me how I feel
Not sure I understand his questioning
He says I've been away a while
But thinks he has cured me
From a state of catatonic sleep
For 30 years where have I been

Eyes open but not getting through to me

Medicate me, infiltrate me
Side effects appear
As my conscience slips away
Medicate me, science failing
Conscience fading fast
Can't you stop what's happening

A higher dosage he prescribes
But there's no guarantee
I feel it starting to take over me
I tell him not to be ashamed
There's no one who's to blame
A second shot, a brief awakening
I feel the relapse, can't break free

Eyes open but not getting through to me

Medicate me, infiltrate me
Side effects appear
As my conscience slips away
Medicate me, science failing
Conscience fading fast
Can't you stop what's happening?

Sailing on the seven, seize the day, tripper diem's ready
Jack the ripper, Owens Wilson, Phillips and my supper's ready
Lucy in the sky with diamond
Dave's not here, I come to save the day for nightmare
Cinema show me the way to get back home again

(Running forward, falling back) Spinning round and round
(Looking outward, reaching in) Scream without a sound
(Leaning over, crawling up) Stumbling all around
(Losing my place only to) Find I've come full circle

Flying off the handle
With careful with that axe
Eugene gene the dance machine
Messiah light my fire gabba gabba
Hey hey, my my generation's home again

(Running forward, falling back) Spinning round and round
(Looking outward, reaching in) Scream without a sound
(Leaning over, crawling up) Stumbling all around
(Losing my place only to) Find I've come full circle

Our deadly sins feel his mortal wrath
Remove all obstacles from our path
Asking questions, search for clues
The answer's been right in front of you
Try to break through, long to connect
Fall on deaf ears and failed muted breath
Loyalty, trust, faith and desire
Carries love through each darkest fire
Tortured insanity, a smothering hell
Try to escape but to no avail
The calls of admirers who claim they adore
Drain all your lifeblood while begging for more
Innocent victims of merciless crimes
Fall prey to some madmen's impulsive designs
Step after step we try controlling our fate
When we finally start living it's become too late

Trapped inside this Octavarium
Trapped inside this Octavarium
Trapped inside this Octavarium
Trapped inside this Octavarium

We move in circles
Balanced all the while
On a gleaming razor's edge
A perfect sphere
Colliding with our fate
This story ends where it began
