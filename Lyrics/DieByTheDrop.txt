Let's dig a hole in the sand, brother
A little grave we can fill together
I got myself a problem
That I've been looking to sell

Some people die just a little (some people die just a little)
Sometimes you die by the drop (sometimes you die by the drop)
Some people die in the middle (some people die in the middle)
I live just fine on the top (hey)

I'm gonna take you for worse or better
I'm gonna make you for worse or better
I'm gonna take you for worse or better
To my little grave

I never said we was equal (I never said we was equal)
I never wished to be saved (I never wished to be saved)
If I'm a problem, then preach on (if I'm a problem, then preach on)
Let's dig a little grave

I'm gonna take you for worse or better
I'm gonna make you for worse or better
I'm gonna take you for worse or better
To my little grave

Let's dig a hole in the sand, brother
Starve off the land for worse or better
Get right down to the bottom
If one goes, I'll do the other

Some people die just a little (some people die just a little)
Sometimes you die by the drop (sometimes you die by the drop)
Some people die in the middle (some people die in the middle)
I live just fine on the top

I'm gonna take you for worse or better
I'm gonna make you for worse or better
I'm gonna take you for worse or better
To my little grave

I'm gonna take you for worse or better (to my little grave)
I'm gonna make you for worse or better (to my little grave)
I'm gonna take you for worse or better
I'm gonna take you for worse or better, for worse or better
To my little grave
