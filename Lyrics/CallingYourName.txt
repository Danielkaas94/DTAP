Serious, is this just another dream
So delirious the way that you make me feel
I can't control myself when you are in my sight
Too dangerous haunting me through the night

You're the reason I can't sleep at night
I hear voices in my head...

The Gods must be insane
They keep calling, keep calling your name
My heart is burning in flames
They keep calling, keep calling your name...

I don't know... maybe you got another man?
So talk to me, I hope that we are more than friends
I would give you all I got just to have you by my side
Come on let me know, give me a sign

You're the reason I can't sleep at night
I hear voices in my head...

The Gods must be insane
They keep calling, keep calling your name
My heart is burning in flames
They keep calling, keep calling your name...
It echoes through the night
I wanna hold you tight
I haven't slept for weeks

'Thou I only know your name
In darkness you're my light
Make the shadows go to sleep
