I'll mimic everything you are to me
The way you walk, the way you talk
The way you breathe
Obsessions, Obsessing
Obsessing, Obsessions
Sing a song, sing your little song
Make it all make sense to me
Obsessing, Obsessions
Can't you see you are what I want my life to be
Oh can't you see you are me, can't you
You are me, dear God please

I don't wanna be everything that this God has planned for me
Can't you see you are my everything
I can't give everything this world will expect from me
You are my everything

Obsessions, Obsessing
Obsessing, Obsessions

When I'm through making me you
I'll be the best you that I can be
Obsessions
Can't you see how perfect you are to me
Can't you see you are me, can't you

See you walk like so
And you talk just like this
Could I be you if I, if I think like you
Can't you see how much you mean to me
I'm not obsessing
Can't you see how much I want your life for me
It's not an obsession
I wanna be just like you

Can't you see you are my everything
Can't you see you are me, you are
Can't you see how much you mean to me
Can't you see you are me
Can't you see you are my everything
Can't you see you are me, you are
Can't you see how much I want your life for me
Can't you see
