You think your head's achin?
I'm not finished yet
I won't be mistaken
How soon you forget
Take back what you said
And I'll spare you pain
Then you can spare me all your fuckin' lies!

"I can't wait
I can't wait
To get away!"

I ask you 20 more times
Don't you hear a thing?
You're testing my patience again
Careful for your sake!
Take a walk with me there
And I'll show you pain
But who said you can open up your mouth?

"I can't wait
I can't wait
To get away!"

Sometimes I just feel like I need to get away
A place where I can be by myself, all alone
I kinda lay down in the back yard
Watch the leaves fall down on my face
It helps me become sane again

Thoughts are pissed away and for a minute I couldn't swallow

I try to go away
(?)
"Can I remember what I did, did it matter?"

Thoughts are pissed away and for a minute I couldn't swallow
If you think that I'm the one who'll be here come tomorrow

You took me in
In time I'll be here
Not waiting, not waiting for you anymore
I love you... I love you anyway
Is it so rare, that I've been sleeping with the dead?
