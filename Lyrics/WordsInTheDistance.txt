Dancing with danger and
Tears in my eyes
Love ain't no stranger
So many goodbyes
Words in the distance
Are calling me

Just when I thought
I could make a a new start
Here comes another fire
Burning in my heart
Words in the distance
Are calling me

And to get to heaven
You gotta go through hell
I cut my heart on the wishing well

You know that I'm crazy
I'm just a fool
To say I love I love I love you
You know that I'm crazy, just a fool
To say I love I love I love you

My senses burning from
The heat of your skin

Deeper than deep
I feel you movin' in, oh
Words in the distance
Are calling me

You know that I'm crazy
I'm just a fool
To say I love I love I love you, well
You know that I'm crazy, just a fool
To say I love I love I love you
I love you

I hold this moment of magic
I hold it in my hand
A single moment of heaven

Don't you know that I'm crazy
I'm just a fool
To say I love I love I love you, yeah
You know that I'm crazy, just a fool
To say I love I love I love you

Don't you know I love you baby
Can't you feel it in my heart, yeah
And I don't know what to say, no
Well I've got a fire in my soul
I don't know which way to go
Or I don't know what to do, no
