Cryin' on the corner, waitin' in the rain
I swear I'll never, ever wait again
You gave me your word, but words for you are lies
Darlin' in my wildest dreams, I never thought I'd go, oh-oh

But it's time to let you know
I'm gonna harden my heart
I'm gonna swallow my tears
I'm gonna turn and leave you here

All of my life, I've been waitin' in the rain
I've been waitin' for a feeling that never, ever came
It feels so close but always disappears
Darlin' in your wildest dreams, you never had a clue

But it's time you got the news
I'm gonna harden my heart
I'm gonna swallow my tears
I'm gonna turn and leave you here

Darlin' in my wildest dreams, I never thought I'd go
But it's time to let you know
I'm gonna harden my heart
I'm gonna swallow my tears

I'm gonna turn and leave you here
I'm a-gonna harden my heart
I'm gonna swallow my tears
I'm a-gonna harden my heart

I'm gonna swallow my tears
Harden my heart
I'm gonna swallow my tears
No, oh, oh, oh
Harden my heart

I'm gonna harden my heart
I'm gonna swallow my tears
I'm gonna harden my heart
I'm gonna swallow my tears

Harden my heart
Harden my heart
Swallow my tears
I'm gonna harden my heart
