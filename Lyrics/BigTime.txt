Hi there!

I'm on my way, I'm making it
I've got to make it show, yeah
Yeah
So much larger than life
I'm gonna watch it growing

The place where I come from
Is a small town
They think so small
They use small words
But not me
I'm smarter than that
I worked it out
I've been stretching my mouth
To let those big words come right out

I've had enough
I'm getting out
To the city
The big, big city
I'll be a big noise
With all the big boys
So much stuff I will own

And I will pray to a big god
As I kneel in the big church

(Big time)
I'm on my way, I'm making it
(Big time)
Oh, yes
(Big time)
I've got to make it show, yeah
(Big time)
(Big time)
So much larger than life
(Big time)
I'm gonna watch it growing
(Big time)

My parties have all the big names
And I greet them with the widest smile
Tell them how my life
Is one big adventure
And always, they're amazed
When I show them 'round the house to my bed
I had it made like a mountain range
With a snow white pillow for my big fat head

And my heaven will be a big heaven
And I will walk through the front door

(Big time)
I'm on my way, I'm making it
(Big time)
(Big time)
I've got to make it show, yeah
(Big time)
(Big time)
So much larger than life
(Big time)
I'm gonna watch it growing
(Big time)

(Big time)
My car's getting bigger
(Big time)
My house, getting bigger
(Big time)
My eyes, getting bigger
(Big time)
And my mouth
(Big time)
My belly's getting bigger
(Big time)
And my bank account
(Big time)
Look at my circumstance
(Big time)
And the bulge in my-
Big, big, big, big, big, big, big
Big, big, big, big, big, big, big
Big
