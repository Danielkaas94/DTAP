ou tie me down
Try to take samples for examples
You could never see walk on me
Watch where you're stomping
Walk with caution
You couldn't comprehend

Step inside and see, justify

You could never see my life is
You could never be my life is
You will never try my life is
Understanding me, understanding me

What do you know about me?
Am I alive? Can I see?
What's happening around me?
Put me down without even speaking
Forever thinking
You couldn't understand

Step inside and see, compromise

You could never see my life is
You could never be my life is
You will never try my life is
Understanding me, understanding me

(Taste it)
Take a look inside and see
(Focus)
(Nobody)
Take a look inside and see
Nobody knows what scars these eyes

Step inside and see

You could never see my life is
You could never be my life is
You will never try my life is
Understanding me, understanding me

You could never see my life is
You could never be my life is
You will never try my life is
Understanding me, understanding me
