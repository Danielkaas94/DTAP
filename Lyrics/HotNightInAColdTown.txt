Sonny's out strolling, ambling slowly
Washed in amber street lights
A mexican wind blows in
Takin' ahold of angelina's hair
And her halo
Motors running, muffling the sound
Of the street talk
A big deal's goin' down

In another hot night
In a cold town
Got yourself a hot night
In a cold town

Johnny's got spare change
In his pocket
A ring and a watch
To hock for a sweet ride
A one way ticket
Hidden in his shoe
These last few hours
He says he'll spend with you
He's leavin' home without a trace
No forwarding address

He'll never have to face another

Hot night
In a cold town
Got yourself a hot night
In a cold town

Well, the losers and the groovers
And the corner boys
Are hangin' around
Runnin' in and out of doorways
Up and down the stairways
Stray dogs headed for the pound

In another
Hot night in a cold town
Got you, got yourself a
Hot night in a cold, cold town
Cold town

It's just another hot night
In a cold town

Such a cold town
