Several years ago
In a foreign town
Far away from home
I met the Count of Tuscany
A young eccentric man
Bred from royal blood
Took me for a ride
Across the open country side
Get into my car
Let's go for a drive
Along the way I'll be your guide
Just step inside
Maybe you recall
A cannibal curator
A character inspired by my brother's life

Winding through the hills
The city far behind
On and on we drove
Down narrow streets and dusty roads
At last we came upon
A picturesque estate
On sprawling emerald fields
An ancient world of times gone by

Let me introduce
My brother
A bearded gentleman
Historian
Sucking on his pipe
Distinguished accent
Making me uptight
No accident

I want to stay alive
Everything about this place just doesn't feel right
I, I don't want to die
Suddenly I'm frightened for my life
I want to say goodbye
This could be the last time you see me alive
I, I may not survive
Knew it from the moment we arrived

Would you like to see
Our secret holy place?
I come here late at night
To pray to him by candlelight
Then peering through the glass
I saw with disbelief
Still dressed in royal clothes
The saint behind the alter
History recalls
During times of war
Legend has been traced
Back inside these castle walls
Where soldiers came to hide
In barrels filled with wine
Never to escape
These tombs of oak are where they died

Down the cellar stairs
I disappear
Like the angel's share
The end is near
Come and have a taste
A rare vintage
All the finest wines improve with age

I want to stay alive
Everything about this place just doesn't feel right
I, I don't want to die
Suddenly I'm frightened for my life
I want to say goodbye
This could be the last time you see me alive
I, I may not survive
Knew it from the moment we arrived

Could this be the end?
Is this the way I die?
Sitting here alone?
No one by my side
I don't understand
I don't feel that I deserve this
What did I do wrong?
I just don't understand
(I just don't understand)

Give me one more chance
Let me please explain
It's all been circumstance
I'll tell you once again
You took me for a ride
Promising a vast adventure
Next thing that I know
I'm frightened for my life
Now wait a minute man
That's not how it is
You must be confused
That isn't who I am
Please don't be afraid
I would never try to hurt you
This is how we live
Strange although it seems
Please try to forgive
The chapel and the saint
The soldiers and the wine
The fables and the tales
All handed down through time
Of course you're free to go
Go and tell the world my story
Tell about my brother, tell them about me
The Count of Tuscany
