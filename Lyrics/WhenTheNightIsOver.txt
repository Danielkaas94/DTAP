My one and only love
Haven't lonely long enough
Will l find you when the night is over
Tell me where did you go
I've been searchin' high and low
I have only 'til the night is over

And every window I pass
Your reflection in the glass
Makes me wonder if my mind is goin'
Shadows shifting in the rain
Slowly drivin' me insane
By the stars above
I know we were in love
I have only 'til the night is over

I feel the weather change
I hear the river say your name
I watch the birds fly by
I see an emerald in the sky

Now the trail has gone cold
I don't know where else to go
And my time I fear is nearly over
When the ocean drinks the sky
And the city winks its eye
When the night is done you'll vanish in the sun
Will I hold you when the night is over?

Am I lost inside my mind?
There's an emerald in the sky
I hear the river say your name
By the stars above I know we were in love
I hear the river say your name
I have only 'til the night is over
