Throw away my dreams
This fight for my life
Isn't dead and behind me
And I've been told to scream
When no one can hear me it doesn't mean nothing

So make me believe
Just take me away from this hell I've created
And I'm afraid
I'm breakin' my own vows
Knowin' I'll go down in flames

I know this can't be right
There's got to be something more that I can live for
And I can only hide
Inside of this sickness for so long again

So make me believe
Just take me away from this hell I've created
And I'm afraid
I'm breakin my own vows
Knowin' I'll go down
Make me believe
Just take me away from temptation that's calling me
And I'm afraid
I'm breakin' my own vows
Knowin' I'll go down in flames

Runnin' in circles
Confusion is calling my name
Hidin' inside of this poisoning madness again
I'm tired, I'm broken, I'm walking along with the dead
Will I ever feel like I once did?
So make me

Make me believe
Just take me away from this hell I've created
And I'm afraid
I'm breakin' my own vows
Knowin' I'll go down
Make me believe
Make me believe
Make me believe
I'm breakin' my own vows
Knowin' I'll go down in flames
