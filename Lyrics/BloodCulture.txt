It starts with the nature of the human race
As cryptic phantom symptoms
All dwelling in the thinnest veins but
Nothing can reveal the course for this pain
No biopsy or surgery will tell what lies inside of me
Vascular system infected by bacteria 
Lymphatic system's overheating - WBCs are decreasing
Due to leucopenia caused by Zotepine
Rubor, Dolor, Calor, Tumor
Inflammation causing me to die

Inject the meds into my blood
Purify my inner thoughts
Running through my veins
Do it again I must 
To cleanse my blood

Infected is my system; now a system of decay 
Functio lesa, paralysis, toxic venom
Constant spreading through my veins
Central nervous system is shutting down
As my heart begins to fail I feel the pain of pinching nails
It's a needle penetrating the main artery 
Delivering pure life in the form of penicillin
Now I'm healed, oh so healed
But it's only until it starts again 

Now the fight is on to be
Hanging in there but
There seems to be no hope for me 
All is gone -- nothing left
Except for one final crucial test
Please medicate my soul
Insanity is lurking and it's going to take control
Of a corpus oh so weak
Inject the meds into my blood stream

At last my system is recovering from
Severe intoxication and from decontaminating
Biological warfare is saving all of me
Though my mind is scarred for life
I am grateful I survived so now it's time
To leave this hospital for good
And to live the life I want 
Not fearing what is in my blood
I want it all -- I don't care what it may cost 
I want it all -- I won't waste this second chance I got
