I'll be the fox by the road, I am
Enormous and evolved
A predatory mass, in the dark I am unseen
Me dripping oil from my tail and my
Eyes are through the fumes
Yellow as the arc of imagined LEDs

I leave a path in the snow, little
Rainbow diesel paws
I devour the smoke that erupts from all exhaust
I make a dash for the median
There's a banshee searing past
And everything is light and it's noise and I reach the grass

My eyes are wide and my teeth dropping
Straight out of my skull
They clatter on the road anatomically displayed
I am as lithe as a vine as I
Whisper up the verge
And I am almost up to the shoulders of a horse

Little sea anemone, pool of rocks
Why'd you see an enemy I cannot?
Could there be a more heavenly artifact
As pure as that?
A little sea anemone, pool of rocks
Why'd you see an enemy I cannot?
Could there be a more heavenly artifact
As pure as that?
A little sea anemone, pool of rocks
Why'd you see an enemy I cannot?
Could there be a more heavenly artifact
As pure as that?
A little sea anemone, pool of rocks
Why'd you see an enemy I cannot?

I sleep a while in the dark of a
Warehouse by the sea
I am now as giant as the sun I used to love
My limbs are shoots springing forth, I am
Impossible and black
And I can feel the gravity rushing into me

I feel a pull on my fur and a
A hundred tiny hands
I can feel the men and the women clamber on
They will embrace me tonight as a
A father and a son
And I will carry homo sapiens through the night

I can not imagine the things they did to you
I can not imagine the way it feels for you
I can feel the gravity rushing into me
I am but a hole in the fabric of the scene
I was but a drop in the ocean all along
