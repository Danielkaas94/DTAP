I am in a living hell, makes me wonder if I'm alive
Can't seem to bring myself to figure out why
I shove and I pull away to the things that I call you every day
I can't seem to break you down, but I know I'll come around
I feel your pins through my eyes piercing me

Lie down in all this piss, you drink it from me every day
I live in a world of shit, been left here to die
Sometimes I realize my mind is meant to go away
Never have I seen your God, so why should I believe in faith?
I feel your pins through my eyes piercing me all the time

Another time bomb
Another time bomb, time bomb, time, time, time, time
Hey!

I am in a living hell, makes me wonder if I'm alive
Can't seem to bring myself to figure out why
I shove and I pull away to the things that I call you every day
I can't seem to break you down, but I know I'll come around
I feel your pins through my eyes piercing me all the time

I never find the time to find another fuckin' place
I'm a bad motherfucker who lives it every day
You never look at me now, you never look me in the face
I'm a time bomb, time bomb, baby

I can't find the time to find a place
I'm a bad motherfucker who lives it every day
You never look at me now, you never look me in the face
I'm a time bomb, yeah

Yeah!
What am I waiting for?

What am I waiting for?

I never find the time to find another place
I'm a bad motherfucker who lives it every day
You never look at me now, you never look me in the face
I'm a time bomb, time bomb, yeah
Yeah!
