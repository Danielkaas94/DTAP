Quite some time, I been sittin' it out
Didn't take no chances, I was a prisoner of doubt
I knocked down the wailin' wall, ain't no sin
Got the feel of fortune, deal me in

Comin' straight on for you
You made my mind
Now I'm stronger, now I'm comin' through
Straight on, straight on for you
Straight on for you

Now I know I got to play my hand
What the winner don't know, a gambler understands
My heart keeps playin' it through with you, my friend
I'll take my chances on you again and again, again

Comin' straight on for you
You made my mind
Now I'm stronger, now I'm comin' through
Straight on, straight on for you
Straight on for you

Comin' straight on for you
You made my mind
And now I'm stronger, now I'm comin' through
Straight on, straight on for you
Straight on, straight on
Straight on for you
Straight on for you

You made my mind
Now I'm stronger, now I'm comin' through
Straight on, straight on for you
Straight on, straight on
I'm straight on for you
Straight on for you
