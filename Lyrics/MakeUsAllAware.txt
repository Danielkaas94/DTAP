Pale to the mountains my existence seems
Sad as the cry of my unanswered dreams
Long have I waited for time to make clear
All of the reasons that I must be here

But I won't care if you are there
Make us all aware

Drawn by the river, we watch as it flows
Wanting to taste of the wisdom it holds
Knowing that somewhere our fortunes we'll find
But fortunes are something we hold in our minds

We could share all that's there
Make us all aware (make us all aware)

Seeking an answer yet harboring fear
That the day that it comes, I'll no longer be here

But I won't care if you are there
I won't care
Make us all
Lord, I won't care
Make us all (make us all aware)
