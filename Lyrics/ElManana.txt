Summer don't know me no more
He got mad, that's all

Summer don't know me
He just let me loathe in my sin
Cause I do know love
From you then
Just died, yeah

I saw that day
Lost my mind
Lord, I'm fine
Maybe in time
You'll want to be mine

Don't stop the bud when it comes
It's the dawn, you'll see
Money won't get there
Ten years passed tonight, you'll flee
If you do, then
I'll be sworn
To find you

I saw that day
Lost my mind
Lord, I'm fine
Maybe in time
You'll want to be mine

I saw that day
Lost my mind
Lord, I'm fine
Maybe in time
You'll want to be mine

Maybe in time, you'll want to be mine
Maybe in time, you'll want to be mine
