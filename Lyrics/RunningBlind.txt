Can't find the answers
I've been crawling on my knees
Looking for anything
To keep me from drowning

Promises have been turned to lies
Can't even be honest inside
Now I'm running backward
Watching my life wave me goodbye

Running blind, I'm running blind
Somebody help me see, I'm running blind

Searching for nothing
Wondering if I'll change
I'm trying everything
But everything still stays the same

I thought if I showed you I could fly
Wouldn't need anyone by my side?
Now I'm running backward
With broken wings I know I'll die

Running blind, I'm running blind
Somebody help me see, I'm running blind
Running blind, running blind, running blind

I can't find the answers
I've been crawling on my knees
Looking for anything
To keep me from drowning
I'm running blind, running blind
Running blind, running blind
Running blind, running blind
Running blind, running blind, running blind
