Writhing and embraced
Retribution, soul eclipse turns solid
Energized
Sucking vomit, acting like its honey
Deprived of I
Falling while thrusting squares through circles
Serving one single new dimension

Terror rising
Agnostics' nemesis
A prophet of extinction

I scorch the skies before your very eyes
My deliverance
Enslavement labelled love

Just trust this, nemesis, to sign and seal extinction
