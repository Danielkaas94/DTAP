I was walking in the park
Dreaming of a spark
When I heard the sprinklers whisper
Shimmer in the haze of summer lawns

Then I heard the children singing
They were running through the rainbows
They were singing a song for you
Well it seemed to be a song for you
The one I wanted to write for you, for you, you

Lavenders blue, dilly dilly, lavenders green
When I am king, dilly dilly
You will be queen
A penny for your thoughts my dear
A penny for your thoughts my dear
I O U for your love
I O U for your love

Lavenders green, dilly dilly, lavenders blue
When you love me, dilly dilly, I will love you
A penny for your thoughts my dear
A penny for your thoughts my dear
I O U for your love
I O U for your love

Lavender dreams dilly, dilly, lavenders true
When you missed me dilly dilly, I did miss you
A penny for your thoughts my dear
A penny for your thoughts my dear
I O U for your love
I O U for your love
For your love, for your love, for your love

Oh I'm gonna get back to you
Gonna find my way back to you
For your love, for your love, for your love

I'm always walking in the park
Always dreaming of a spark
From you
