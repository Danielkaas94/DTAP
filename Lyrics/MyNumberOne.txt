You're my lover, undercover
You're my sacred passion and I have no other
You're delicious, so capricious
If I find out you don't want me I'll be vicious!

Say you love me and you'll have me
In your arms forever and I won't forget it

Say you miss me
Come and kiss me
Take me up to heaven and you won't regret it
(Hey!)

You are the one
You're my number one
The only treasure I'll ever have
You are the one
You're my number one
Anything for you 'cause you're the one I love
(You're my lover...)
(Hey!)

You're a fire and desire
When I kiss your lips, you know, you take me higher
You're addiction, my conviction
You're my passion, my relief, my crucifixion

Never leave me
And believe me
You will be the sun into my raining season
Never leave me
And believe me
In my empty life you'll be the only reason...
(Hey!)

You are the one
You're my number one
The only treasure I'll ever have
You are the one
You're my number one
Anything for you 'cause you're the one I love

You're my lover, undercover
You're my sacred passion and I have no other

(Hey!)
You are the one
You're my number one
The only treasure I'll ever have
You are the one
You're my number one
Anything for you 'cause you're the one I love
