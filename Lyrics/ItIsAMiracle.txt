Miraculous you call it babe
You ain't seen nothing yet
They've got Pepsi in the Andes
They've McDonalds in Tibet
Yosemite's been turned into
A golf course for the Japs
And the Dead Sea is alive with rap

Between the Tigris and Euphrates
There's a leisure centre now
They've got all kinds of sports
They've got Bermuda shorts
They had sex in Pennsylvania
A Brazilian grew a tree
And a doctor in Manhattan
Saved a dying man for free

It's a miracle
It's a miracle
It's a miracle
Another miracle

By the grace of God Almighty
And the pressures of marketplace
The human race has civilized itself
It's a miracle

We've got a warehouse of butter
We've got oceans of wine
We've got famine when we need it
We've got a designer crime
We've got Mercedes
We've got Porsche
Ferrari and Rolls Royce
Yeah
We've got a choice

She said meet me
In the Garden of Gethsemane my dear
The Lord said Peter I can see
Your house from here
An honest man
Finally reaped what he had sown
And a farmer in Ohio has just repaid a loan

It's a miracle
It's a miracle
It's a miracle
Another miracle

By the grace of God Almighty
And pressures of marketplace
The human race has civilized itself
It's a miracle

We cower in our shelters
With our hands over our ears
Lloyd-Webber's awful stuff
Runs for years and years and years
An earthquake hits the theatre
But the operetta lingers
Then the piano lid comes down
And breaks his fucking fingers
It's a miracle
