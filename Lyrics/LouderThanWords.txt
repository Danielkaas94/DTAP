Actions speak louder than words do

Actions speak louder

Shut up!

So here we go again
You're opening your mouth
Before you think
Your insincerities
Are clinging to me like the stench of your last drink
Shut up!

Did I really hear you say you're sorry?
Hard for me to believe
I don't get how you're buying your own story
You're piss broke emotionally

I'm watching
Listening
The volume's always the same

Actions speak louder than words do
I don't want to hear dead words from you
Actions speak louder than words do
I just want to see what you will do
Shut up!

So here it comes again
A deafening parade of duplicity
Birds falling from the sky
The air is poisoned by the breath
You waste on me
Shut up!

The thought of you has become so disappointing
Hard for you to believe?
You never seem to fail to change the stories
You so effortlessly breed

I'm watching
Listening
The volume's always the same

Actions speak louder than words do
I don't want to hear dead words from you
Actions speak louder than words do
I just want to see what you will do
Shut up!

Shut up!
Actions speak louder...

It's time to play again
Deception is your game
But why would you want to wear that shame?
It speaks louder than words

Shut up!

Actions speak louder than words do
I don't want to hear dead words from you
Actions speak louder than words do
I just want to see what you will do

The thought of you has become so disappointing
Actions speak louder than words do (So here we go again)
Shut up!

The volume's always the same

Actions speak louder
Shut up!
