Blitz
You test me no more
I'm calm
Now absent
I'm date-rape yellow
Black to the liver, come on

Take my lung, take my loose tongue
Take my sum, take my memory
Of nothing at all, nothing at all, that's what you remind me
No thread, no lips, no postscripts
No eclipse of my liberty
Oh, pedigree chum, pedigree chum, I'm never your father

But who's gonna sit on your face when I'm gone?
Who's gonna sit on your face when I'm not there?

More
My arc lights, my knees
When she casts off
Her clothes, I don't know what is reality

My death throes, this indefinite pose
Her flesh codes inconceivable
Oh, suffragette, suffragette, I wanna be outlawed and AWOL
No alphabet can be used yet
No cassette is available
Oh, I dunno how, I dunno how I'm gonna reset my whole radar

Forget (who's gonna sit on your face when I'm gone?)
Forget (who's gonna sit on the fence when I'm not there?)

Who's gonna sit on your face when I'm gone?
Who's gonna sit on the fence when I'm not there?
Who's gonna sit on your face when I'm gone?
Who's gonna sit on the fence when I'm not there?

Of nothing at all, nothing at all, that's what you remind me
And the balls in your court, in the court, your ball
Oh, suffragette, suffragette, I wanna be outlawed and AWOL but

Who's gonna sit on your face when I'm gone?
Who's gonna sit on the fence when I'm not there?
Who's gonna sit on your face when I'm gone?
Who's gonna sit on the fence when I'm not there?

Who's gonna sit on your face when I'm gone?
Who's gonna sit on the fence when I'm not there?
Who's gonna sit on your face when I'm gone?
Who's gonna sit on the fence when I'm not there?

Who's gonna sit on your face when I'm gone?
Who's gonna sit on the fence when I'm not there?
Who's gonna sit on your face when I'm gone?
Who's gonna sit on the fence when I'm not there?
