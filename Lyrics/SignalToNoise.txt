You know the way that things go
When what you fight for starts to fall

And in that fuzzy picture
The writing stands out on the wall
So clearly on the wall

Send out the signals, deep and loud
And in this place can you reassure me
With a touch, a smile while the cradle's burning
All the while the world is turning to noise

Oh, the more that it's surrounding us
The more that it destroys
Turn up the signal
Wipe out the noise

Send out the signals, deep and loud
Man, I'm losing sound and sight
Of all those who can tell me wrong from right
When all things beautiful and bright sink in the night

Yet there's still there's something in my heart
That can find a way to make a start
To turn up the signal
Wipe out the noise

Wipe out the noise

Wipe out the noise

You know that's it
You know that's it
You know that's it

No receive and transmit
No receive
