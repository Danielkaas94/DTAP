When you scream aloud
Heads down, heads down
That's when I plan to
Rise up, rise up
When you scream aloud
We're doomed, we're doomed
That's when I plan to prove myself to you

I've never gotten the simple thrill of solo day
I've never seen the point in you, killing you
I've always backed my words with what I do
I'll always bite my tongue to comfort you

I'll be my superhero #1
I'll save me from myself

I... I rise
Above the sun in the sky
Above that look in your eyes
My pride

Sister you know me
Si-sister you know me
Mother you made me
Lover what do you offer me?
Father teach me
Brother protect
Lover what do you have for me?

I'll be my superhero #1
I'll save me from myself
I'll be your superhero #1
I'll save you... I save

I... I rise
Above the sun in the sky
Above that look in your eyes
My pride

I'll save you, I'll save you, I'll save you
Your eyes deny, a life that dulls your pride
Your eyes they hide, through me you'll heal with time, Yeah

When you scream aloud
Heads down, heads down
That's when I plan to
Rise up, rise up
When you scream aloud
We're doomed, we're doomed
That's when I plan to prove myself to you

I'll be my superhero #1
I'll save me from myself
I'll be your superhero #1
I'll save you... I save

I... I rise
Above the sun in the sky
Above that look in your eyes
My pride
I'll be your superhero #1 (I...)
I'll save you from yourself (I rise, above the sun in the sky)
I'll be my superhero #1 (above the look in your eyes)
I'll save me
My pride
