Sweet child in time
You'll see the line
The line that's drawn between
Good and bad

See the blind man
Shooting at the world
Bullets flying
Oh, taking toll

If you've been bad
Oh Lord, I bet you have
And you've not been hit
Oh, by a flying lead

You'd better close your eyes
Oh-oh, bow your head
Wait for the ricochet

Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh

Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh

Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Oh, I wanna hear you sing

Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Oh-oh

Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh

Ahh-ah-ah
Ahh-ah-ah
Ahh-ah

Sweet child in time
You'll see the line
The line that's drawn between
Good and bad

See the blind man
Shooting at the world
Bullets flying
Mmm, taking toll

If you've been bad
Lord, I bet you have
And you've not been hit
Oh, by a flying lead

You'd better close your eyes
Oh-oh, bow your head
Wait for the ricochet

Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh

Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh

Ahh-ah-ah
Ahh-ah-ah
Ahh-ah-ah
Oh, I gotta hear you screaming

Ahh-ah-ah
Ahh-ah-ah
Ahh-ah-ah
Oh-oh

Ahh-ah-ah
Ahh-ah-ah
Ahh-ah-ah
Oh

Ahh-ah-ah
Ahh-ah-ah
Ahh-ah-ah

Oh, no
Oh, no
God, oh, no
Oh, no
Oh, ain't gonna do it
Oh, no
Oh, no, no
Oh
Ohh!
Oh, no
