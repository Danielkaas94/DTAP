We're gettin' noplace fast as we can
Get a noseful from our so-called friends

We're gettin' nowhere quick as we know how
We whirl from town to town treatment bound

First thing we do when we finally pull up
Get shitfaced drunk try to sober up

There'll be no pose tonight no money in sight
Label wants a hit and we don't give a shit

Because we're gettin' noplace as fast as we can
We get a noseful from our so-called friends

We're gettin' nowhere quick as we know how
We whirl from town to town Duluth to Madison
Treatment bound

Gettin' nowhere

(Keep goin')

Second thing we do is walk around
Goto the job or try to hold one down

There's no mass appeal carton's asleep at the wheel
Yesterday's trash too bored to thrash

We're gettin' nowhere fast as we can
We got a noseful of them so-called friends

We're gettin no place as quick as we know how
We're gettin' nowhere what will we do now?

Take it, Scotty
