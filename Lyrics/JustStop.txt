Just stop enough of the venomous critical comments on my life
Just stop the judgment and all of your pseudo-involvement in my life
Sit back a moment, and look at the miracle starting in the light
Don't stop a moment, and let the incredible happen knowing that

All that you want is to criticize
Something for nothing
And all that I want is forgiveness one more time
To be the best in the world

(Ahou) Just stop with all of your little deliberate problems with my life
Enough of all the crippling, terrible pain we feelinside
Step back a moment, remember how the miracle started in the light
Take back the torment, I'll only enjoy this moment knowing that

All that you want is to criticize
Something for nothing
And all that I want is forgiveness one more time
I know that
All that we want is to feel inside
Some kind of comfort
And all that we've done
We can hide
We'll be the best in the world

All I ever wanted was to be a real source of compassion
From the moment that we found ourselves drowning
All I ever wanted was to be a real source of compassion
From the moment that we found ourselves drowning

All that you want is to criticize
Something for nothing
And all that I want is forgiveness one more time
I know that
All that we want is to feel inside
Some kind of comfort
And all that we've done
We can hide
We'll be the best in the world
We'll be the best in the world
Just stop enough of the venemous critical comments on my life
Just stop the judgment and all of your pseudo-involvement in my life
