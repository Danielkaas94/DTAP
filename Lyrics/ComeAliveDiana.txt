Come alive, Diana
I don't have time to dig a grave
But I know it's the only option left to me now
Summer has sucked the stone and burst your tyres

On the shore, you found him
Warped and wild were his eyes
And they shook and they quivered in their sockets
Like a bullet, they ricocheted between your thighs

Her phantom head
Is thinking for all mankind, I saw her portrait in the Mail
Her phantom head was directing the holiest of hunts
I made mistakes
I lost an author, ooh, and then I lost a daughter's awe
I don't know how you'd affect it more

Her phantom head (head)
Her phantom head (head)
Her phantom head (head)
Her phantom head (head)

Line the streets, Diana
With armoured cars, oh, column inch
Timeless inch, can you inch another centimeter
Closer to hearts and minds? You'll win them yet

And the young Diana
She waves inside a global grief
In a wind, gonna Praia her, gonna Luz her
And the patterns emerge like germs, lest we forget
(He told me, he, he, he told me)

Her phantom head
Is thinking for all mankind, I saw her portrait in the Mail
Her phantom head was directing the holiest of hunts
I made mistakes
I lost an author, ooh, and then I lost a daughter's awe
I don't know how you'd affect it more

They're ringing and ringing the Liberty Bell
And I can feel the heat, I can hear the heat
Rising from that Aryan, Aryan, Aryan knell
And mother looks away, father looks away, for a second

(Is rolling around some yard while simultaneously wired)

Her phantom head
Is thinking for all mankind, I saw her portrait in the Mail
Her phantom head was directing the holiest of hunts
I made mistakes
I lost an author, ooh, and then I lost a daughter's awe
I don't know how you'd affect it more

Her phantom head (head)
Her phantom head (head)
Her phantom head (head)
Her phantom head (head)

And they're ringing and ringing the Liberty Bell, ah
That Aryan, Aryan, Aryan knell, ah
They're ringing and ringing the Liberty Bell
