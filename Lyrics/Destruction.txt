You backstabber
You spit filth from your mouth
Spitting fire on fire and still claiming devout
You're no better than the demons that are filling your head
You're a medium for malice
Now your destruction begins
I have held my tongue for long enough
Your hate will catch up with, you in the end
Go ahead and write us off
Our fate is already sealed
You don't speak peace
You just salt the wound
You just salt the wound
Hide behind your words
Because who will save you now?

You've spent your lives writing us off
But this time I'll turn it around
Piece by piece your day will come
My destruction lives
My destruction lives

Damnation brings no fear
To the ones inside the gates
The lies you feed the world
You're at the end of your road
We'll never hear the end of this
And you'll never get away with this

You backstabber!
You backstabber!
Just look what you've done
My Destruction lives (x10)
