I'm walking, I'm a southern stream
Get to the river 'fore I run too low
I'm walking, I'm a southern stream
Get to the river 'fore I run too low

Old gypsy woman spoke to me
Lips stained red from a bottle of wine
Old gypsy woman spoke to me
Lips stained red from a bottle of wine
The one that you are looking for
You're not gonna find her here

The one that you are looking for
You're not gonna find her here, here

I'm runnin', I'm a northeast stream
Get to the ocean 'fore I run too low
I'm runnin', I'm a northeast stream
Get to the ocean 'fore I run too low
Get to the ocean 'fore I run too low

The one that you are looking for
You're not gonna find her here
The one that you are looking for
You're not gonna find her here, here

Old gypsy woman spoke to me, said
You're a wolf, boy, get out of this town
Old gypsy woman spoke to me, said
You're a wolf, boy, get out of this town

You're a wolf, boy, get out of this town
You're a wolf, boy, get out of this town
You're a wolf
You're a wolf
You're a wolf
You're a wolf
