Tell me why you came here
Squatting 'round a Game Gear
Like Sega never died
We met inside a war zone
You said, "Let's fuck the Ozone"
But boy, that hole's too wide
You goose-step 'round the garden singing
"Sap I bleed is hardening
No tree can break my stoic stride
I'm as giddy as a baby in a centrifuge
It's hard"

And we can argue that our planet's best
Don't ring your brother 'cause there's no contest
I'm sure you'll make a decent
Father, there's a world war coming in
Oh, the seasons I've been worrying

You drown a fly and murmur
"The Vatican was firmer
When I was back in school
And we used spray tan in the trenches, now
The problem with the French is how
They won't admit they're fools
And you never tell me anything
You never tell me anything
I can't remember dates and times
And I'm sorry for the years I was a shipwreck boy
It's hard"

I want to tell you that it means so much
I want to tell you that it means so much
I'm sure you'll make a decent
Father, there's a world war coming in
Oh, the years that I've been worrying, oh

I'd rather dash myself upon the rocks
Than see you waste away your days with clocks
In every corner of your parent's home
And there's no world war coming in
All the reasons I've been worrying
Just forget the parts you'll never need
All these things I'll tell you when you wake up

Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah

Make a child, make a child, make a forest
Make a child, make a child, make a forest

Make a child (and there's no world war coming in)
A child (all the reasons I've been worrying)
A forest (just forget the parts you'll never need)
(All these things I'll tell you when you wake up)
