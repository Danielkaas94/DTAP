First Sight
Turns me round again
Brings me face to face with my sin
I've got it, Always had it
A reason to look within now
Take flight
To your son again
Burns the sin
Straight from my hands
I've got it, Always had it
A reason to live within now.

Every time I fall, You catch me
And every time I lose control
You help me, you save me
And every time I lose myself
You find me, redefine me

My god
Think my hands have been
Makes me sick from inside out again
I've got it, Always had it
A reason to look within now
Stand close
To my side again
Never stick a knife in my back, friend
I've got it, Always had
A reason to live within now

Every time I fall, You catch me
And every time I lose control
You help me, you save me
And every time I lose myself
You find me, redefine me

Somebody to make me feel whole again
Life gets better
Somebody to make me wanna love again
Life gets better
Somebody to make me see the sun again
Life gets better
Somebody to hold me
Hold me
Life feels better

Every time I fall

Every time I lose control
You help me, you save me
Every time I lose myself
You find me, redefine me
And every time I hate myself
You love me, forgive me
Every time I lose myself
You find me, redefine me.
