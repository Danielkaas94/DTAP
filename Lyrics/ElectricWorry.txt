Well, you made me weep, and you made me moan
When you caused me to leave, child, my happy home
But someday, baby, you ain't worry my life anymore

I get satisfaction everywhere I go
Where I lay my head, that's where I call home
Whether barren pines, or the mission stare
Take tomorrow's collar and give 'em back the glare

Bang, bang, bang, bang
Vámonos, vámonos
Bang, bang, bang
Vámonos, vámonos (hey!)

You told everybody in the neighborhood
What a dirty mistreater, that I was no good
But someday, baby, you ain't worry my life anymore

Doctor or lawyer, I'll never be
Life of a drifter, the only life for me
You can have your riches and all the gold you saved
There ain't room for one thing in everybody's grave

Bang, bang, bang, bang
Vámonos, vámonos
Bang, bang, bang
Vámonos, vámonos (come on)

If I had money like Henry Ford
Lord, I'd have me a woman, yeah, on every road
But someday, baby, you ain't worry my life anymore

Invocation of the dummies, requiem for a head
Cash in at the corner, piles of street cred
I get satisfaction everywhere I go
One day, baby, you'll worry me no more

Bang, bang, bang, bang
Vámonos, vámonos
Bang, bang, bang
Vámonos, vámonos (yeah!)
