Lost your mind when I made you mine
Now we see eye to eye
Rolled dead thoughts and smoked them blind
Still roll them and roll them still

I will consume you
I will soon own you
I am the prize in your game
The victor and loser too

Say you will, say you will
Say you'll always be there to hold me
Say you will, say you will forgive me

Well, I've got my thoughts inside you
The need to pull them through
You know I'll never hurt you
Yesterday but tomorrow will

I'm wrapped inside you
I'm wrapped around you
I am the disease in your veins
Yesterday and tomorrow still

Say you will, say you will
Say you'll always be there to hold me
Say you will, say you will forgive me

Say you will, say you will
Say you'll always be there to catch me
Say you will, say you will forgive me

I'll pick up all your pieces
Puzzle heart, you're missing too
Force them into the wrong places
Act like you want me to

I'll let you meet all my faces
And yet hide the real me from you
I'll show you everything that I
Everything that I want me to

I am inside you
I am around you
I am the disease in your veins
Still you say you will

Say you will, say you will
Say you'll always be there to hold me
Say you will, say you will forgive me

Say you will, say you will
Say you'll always be there to catch me
Say you will, say you will forgive me
