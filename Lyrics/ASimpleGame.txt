As time goes by, you will see
That we're going to be free
You and me, we'll touch the sky

Can you see in your mind's eye
That we are one
We're all the same
And life is just a simple game

There, by your side, I will be
When this crazy world is free
Free from doubt
When it finds out
Exactly what we're meant to be

That we are one
We're all the same
And life is just a simple game

Thoughts of another day
Flashing through my head
Thinking how life could be
All of the things that our great men have said

Be what we want to be
What we deserve to be
What we are meant to be

As time goes by, you will see
That we're going to be free
You and me, we'll touch the sky
Can you see in your mind's eye

That we are one
We're all the same
And life is just a simple game

(We're gonna be free)

(We're gonna be free)

(Gonna be free)
