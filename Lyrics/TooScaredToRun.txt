Too scared I could not run
I could not make a sound
Lights were flashing
My whole life passing
My feet were stuck to the ground

Too light to call it night
Too dark to call it day
Too scared to stay and fight
Too scared to run away

So scared I could not move
I could not make a sound
There were people running
People shouting
Flashes all around

Too scared to run
Too scared to run away

Too scared I could not think
My eyes could not scarcely see
My heart was racing
My legs were shaking
They would not carry me

Lights were flashing
My whole life passing
My heart, my heart
My heart was racing
My legs were shaking
Could not see, I could not see
