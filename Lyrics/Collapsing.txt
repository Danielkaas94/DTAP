I, I see the weight of hollow death residing in you
Take now your final breath
Exhale the truth
I see the fear of nothing left
Dead fragments of youth
You hold it in yourself
I feel it too

I mourn your blindness
I die along
And swallow darkness
In misery is where I belong

Collapsing in on yourself
I don't know why I try (I try)
Collapsing in on yourself
I don't know why you deny

I, I know the light is burning dim and dying in you
I know the pain that lies within
I feel it too

I mourn your blindness
I die along
And swallow darkness
In misery is where I belong

Collapsing in on yourself
I don't know why I try (I try)
Collapsing in on yourself
I don't know why you deny

Collapsing in on yourself
I don't know why I try (I try)
Collapsing in on yourself
I don't know why you deny

Collapsing in on yourself
I don't know why I try (I try)
Collapsing in on yourself
I don't know why you deny
