Broken shards
All that we are at sometime
Scattered around
What you try to control all your life
It's not a matter of fate, it's just a question of time, and we all fall down
It's not a matter of fate, it's just a question of time, and we all fall down

I've been stranded and paid to die on the side of the road
I've been shot just because my heart
I've lost the times I've been bought and sold
I've been the victim of golden eyes
I've seen the dead walk among the living
In division, what's stripped away is made the same on the other side

Because I've seen the underside of power
It's a game that can't go on
It could break down any hour
I've seen their faces and I've known them all

Once I vanished to reappear as an object of love
I've been ripped from the inside out
And then delivered in the hands of the devil
I've been convicted of ancient crimes
And made to drift from Hell to treason
In division is stripped away is made the same on the underside

Because I've seen the underside of power
It's just a game that can't go on
It could break down any hour
I've seen their faces and I've known them all

We're on the wrong side of the power
It's a shadow
It's just a fire thrown across the wall

Hold on
Standfast
Stay strong
Change is coming on
One day a change is gonna come

Because I've seen the underside of power
It's just a game that can't go on
It could break down any hour
I've seen their faces and I've known them all

We're on the wrong side of the power
It's a shadow
It's just a fire thrown across the wall

Because I've seen the underside of power
It's just a game that can't go on
It could break down any hour
I've seen their faces and I've known them all
