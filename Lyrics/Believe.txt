Believe
When you lie
You will never need to recognize yourself
To deceive
To remove all chance of doubt and be received
With your lie
The deception is complete when you concede
And decide
To reject your lives
Sacrificed to me

Penance can't absolve your sin
Into me
Penance can't absolve your sin

All your belief
Cannot absolve your sin
All your belief
Cannot absolve your sin

Believe
When you lie
You will never need to recognize the source
Of deceit
To renew your faith in God
You must believe
In your lie
The redemption is complete when you conceive
And decline (and decline)
To release your lives
Sacrificed to me

Penance can't absolve your sin
Into me
Penance can't absolve your sin

All your belief
Cannot absolve your sin
All your belief
Cannot absolve your sin

Ho, reap your life
Like you want to recognize
All you've come to
Reap your life
Like you want to recognize
All you've come to

Reap your life
Veiled in shadow
Recognize
Faces of the crucified
I can hear their screams tonight
Ever haunting me

Burn your lie

Into me
Penance can't absolve your sin
Into me
Penance can't absolve your sin

All your belief
Cannot absolve your sin
All your belief
Cannot absolve your sin
All your, all your belief
Cannot absolve your sin
All your, all your belief
Cannot absolve your sin
