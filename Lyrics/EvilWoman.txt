You made a fool of me
But them broken dreams have got to end

Hey woman, you got the blues
Yes you ain't got no one else to use
There's an open road that leads nowhere
So just make some miles between here and there

There's a hole in my head where the rain comes in
You took my body and played to win
Ha ha woman, it's a crying shame
But you ain't got nobody else to blame

Evil woman, evil woman
Evil woman, evil woman

Rolled in from another town
Hit some gold too hot to settle down
But a fool and his money soon go separate ways
And you found that fool lyin' in a daze

Ha ha woman, what you gonna do?
You destroyed all the virtues that the Lord gave you
It's so good that you're feeling pain
Yes you better get your face on board the very next train

Evil woman, evil woman
Evil woman (evil woman), evil woman

Evil woman, evil woman
Evil woman (you're an evil woman), evil woman

Evil woman how you done me wrong
But now you're tryin' to wail a different song
Ha ha funny how you broke me up
You made the wine now you drink the cup

I came runnin' every time you cried
Thought I saw love smilin' in your eyes
Ha ha very nice to know
That you ain't got no place well left to go

Evil woman, evil woman
Evil woman (evil woman), evil woman

Evil woman, evil woman (you're an evil woman)
Evil woman (such an evil woman) evil woman (you're an evil woman)
Evil woman, evil woman (such an evil woman)
