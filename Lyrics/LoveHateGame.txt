I keep your face deep inside try to hide
All my memories bring you up again, up again
I keep a place deep inside try to hide you
All my hate speaks your name again, name again

Love, hate, game, sinner, saint, same
Don't you recall what you did to me? Look at me now
Don't you remember what you've done to me? Look at me

I wish my pain onto you, all onto you,
All the anger that you've spun in me, spun in me
Your mark was deep oh so true, shame on you
My mistrust was all from you, all from you

Love, hate, game, sinner, saint, same
Don't you recall what you did to me? Look at me now
Don't you remember what you've done to me? Look at me
Don't you recall what you did to me? Look at me now
Don't you remember what you've done to me? Look at me

Right, right, one, two, a million words for you
You are so perfect, every time I swear I curse you
You're so damn faceless, with every look you drew me in
You were so perfect, your games wore thin so says

I keep my pain deep inside try to hide you
All your words bring me, bring me down again
You love me, you hate me, its all your game
You're a sinner, you're a saint, we ain't the same

Don't you recall what you did to me? Look at me now
Don't you remember what you've done to me? Look at me
Don't you recall what you did to me? Look at me now
Don't you remember what you've done to me? Look at me
