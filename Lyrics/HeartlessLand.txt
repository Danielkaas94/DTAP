I know the world is full of light
So why can't things just work out right
Oh take me, take me
From this heartless land
It used to be so full of love
But now it's only push and shove
Oh take me, take me
From this heartless land

Just a breath of new life
Into an empty sky
From deep inside, where love must lie

No need to play the perfect fool
Stand up for love, break the rule
Oh come with me
You know that you can
I see the sky, I see the ground
What's in between must now be found
There is no life
Inside this heartless land

Just a breath of new life
Into an empty sky
Somewhere in your soul
Where love must lie

And I say ... come to the light
Everyday is getting closer
To your sweet surrender
Out of the cold
'Cause I found a way
That we can fly forever
With direction and peace of mind
The river will flow

Come to the light, my love
'Cause I need you here
I need you here tonight

The chains of love they run so deep
But the hand that writes the law is weak
Oh take me, take me
From this heartless land
'Cause it's the place the broken go
The place that we don't want to know
There is no love
Inside this heartless land
