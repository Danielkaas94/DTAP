I am broken by my birthright
And made to die by design
I was put on this earth to fail you
Why do you put your faith in me?
I will let you down
I will give you a reason to hate me
I will give you a reason to despise me

I never thought I'd see the day
When I'd see my maker face to face
Every sin accounted for
Every bad decision I ever made
Little did I know this would all lead up to this
This is my time
This is my breaking point

I'll pay my price
Just please don't let me miss
My peace of mind
I'll even die for this
God ease my soul
And don't let me forget
That there is nothing forcing me to a bitter end

I can't stand another day in my head
All the pain
All the lies
It's wearing me thin
Why can't I just follow you?
Oh God, it's taking over

This is a takeover
My eyes have learned to lust
And my mind was molded to betray you
I've let this spite fill my lungs
Fill my lungs
This is my breaking point
This is my breaking point
This will not be my bitter end

I'll pay my price
Just please don't let me miss
My peace of mind
I'll even die for this
God ease my soul
And don't let me forget
That there is nothing forcing me to a bitter end
I'll pay my price
Just please don't let me miss
My peace of mind
I'll even die for this
God ease my soul
And don't let me forget
That there is nothing forcing me to a bitter end
Bitter end
Bitter end
This is my breaking point
