Well did you notice
What's wrong with me
No I can't even breathe
When my head's low
It's not with shame
It's from this pain you bring

Well I can feel it again
This loss is slowly crushing me

Through all this pain and suffering
I need you back in my arms
After all this pain and suffering
I want you back in my arms

Do you like my frown
I had a smile once
You turned it upside down
Make amends with me
No I can't even see
The reason behind your needs

Well I can feel it again
This loss is slowly crushing me

Through all this pain and suffering
I need you back in my arms
After all this pain and suffering
I want you back in my arms

All your words follow me
With pain and sorrow
Assuring me for all to say
This pain and sorrow

This loss is slowly crushing me
This loss is slowly crushing me
I want you back in my arms

Make it stop
Make it stop
Make it stop

Through all this pain and suffering
I need you back in my arms
After all this pain and suffering
I want you back in my arms

Through all this pain and suffering
I need you back in my arms
After all this pain and suffering
I want you back in my arms
