A ghost of the ocean
Tells of the women of the sea
They ran from oppression
In the forgotten history

No innocents
No leader to defend
No god, no government
And it's hard to believe
They were riders on the sea

Women of fortune
Always to be prepared to die
Blood on the knife edge
Flag of the sea lord flying high

A world of action strong and free
Adventure war and loyalty
The mermaid tyrant loved to fight
She ties the noose and pulls it tight

Treacherous island
Somewhere to hide on no man's land
Ships in the harbour
Waiting to hear the battle plan
