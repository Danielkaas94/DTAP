Come and share my moonlit stair
Things of beauty everywhere
So much luck it isn't fair
'Cos the tears of the world
Keep falling

I got the best of everything
A better world I could not dream
You should see what I have seen
As the tears of the world keep falling

Ah ah ah ah ah ah
The tears of the world keep falling
Ah ah ah ah ah ah
Until we stand together
Ah ah ah ah ah ah
The tears of the world keep falling
Ah ah ah ah ah ah
Until we stand together

So much wealth on every face
You're in the fight to win the place
Or are you just a hopeless case
As the tears of the world keep falling

You'd like to think that it's not cruel
Design your future by their rules
You worship at the feet of fools
While the tears of the world
Keep falling

Ah ah ah ah ah ah
The tears of the world keep falling
Ah ah ah ah ah ah
Until we stand together
Ah ah ah ah ah ah
The tears of the world keep falling
Ah ah ah ah ah ah
Until we take control together

We pushed our way to reach our goal
Turning silver into gold
We need to take complete control
As the tears of the world keep falling

The great divide we know so well
Will be there at the last farewell
Unless we break this living hell
As the tears of the world keep falling

Ah ah ah ah ah ah
The tears of the world keep falling
Ah ah ah ah ah ah
Until we stand together
Ah ah ah ah ah ah
The tears of the world keep falling
Ah ah ah ah ah ah
Until we learn to stand together
