A change of scene
A change of style
A change of hopes
With no regrets
A chance to watch
Admire the distance
Still occupied
Though you forget

Different colours, different shades
Over each mistakes were made
I took the blame
Directionless, so plain to see
A loaded gun won't set you free
So you say

We'll share a drink and step outside
An angry voice and one who cried
I'll give you everything and more
The strain's too much, can't take much more
I've walked on water, run through fire
Can't seem to feel it anymore
Because we
Hoping for something more
Hoping for something else
Me, you seeing me this time
You're hoping for something more
When our love goes wrong!
