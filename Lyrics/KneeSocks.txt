You got the lights on in the afternoon
And the nights are drawn out long
And you're kissin' to cut through the gloom
With a cough drop coloured tongue

And you were sittin' in the corner with the coats all piled high
And I thought you might be mine
In a small world, on an exceptionally rainy Tuesday night
In the right place and time

When the zeros line up on the 24 hour clock
When you know who's callin' even though the number is blocked
When you walked around your house wearin' my sky blue Lacoste
And your knee socks

Well, you cured my January blues
Yeah, you made it all alright
I've got a feelin' I might have lit the very fuse
That you were tryin' not to light

You were a stranger in my phonebook I was actin' like I knew
'Cause I had nothin' to lose
When the winter's in full swing and
Your dreams just aren't comin' true
Ain't it funny what you'll do?

When the zeros line up on the 24 hour clock
When you know who's callin' even though the number is blocked
When you walked around your house wearin' my sky blue Lacoste
And your knee socks

The late afternoon, the ghost in your room
That you always thought didn't approve
Of you knockin' boots
Never stopped you lettin' me get hold
Of the sweet spot by the scruff of your
Knee socks

You and me could have been a team
Each had a half of a king and queen seat
Like the beginnin' of Mean Streets
You could be my baby

You and me could have been a team
Each had a half of a king and queen seat
Like the beginnin' of Mean Streets
You could be my baby

You and me could have been a team
Each had a half of a king and queen seat
Like the beginnin' of Mean Streets
You could be my baby

You and me could have been a team
Each had a half of a king and queen seat
Like the beginnin' of Mean Streets
You could be my baby

When the zeros line up on the 24 hour clock
When you know who's callin' even though the number is blocked
When you walked around your house wearin' my sky blue Lacoste
And your knee socks

When the zeros line up on the 24 hour clock
When you know who's callin' even though the number is blocked
When you walked around your house wearin' my sky blue Lacoste
And your knee socks

Knee socks
