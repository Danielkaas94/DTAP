In a dream within a dream, we saw beyond the sky
And drew a constellation in the shape of Gemini
We turned our sails into the wind
And climbed up to the heights
Raised a glass and made a toast and wrote our name in lights

Forever and ever
Children of the moon
In the lap of the gods

Fare thee well
Fare thee well
Fare thee well
Fare thee well

Echoes and effigies whispering your name
Drifting farther from your voice
Silenced with so much left to say
And the space that you left behind cannot be disguised
Raise a glass and make a toast to one in paradise

Forever and ever
Silence be damned
Your songs will live on

Fare thee well
Fare thee well
Fare thee well
Fare thee well

Time and tide will carry me from the last goodbye
I can hear, don't answer me
With the sky in your eye (sky in your eye)
When the raven tapped upon your door
He was singing your own tune
Son of wolf and father of words
The curtains closed too soon

Fare thee well (fare thee well)
(Fare thee well)
Fare thee well (fare thee well)
(Fare thee well)
Fare thee well (fare thee well)
