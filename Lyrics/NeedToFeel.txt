Tell me what you want to be, and don't hide it from me
Tell me where you want to be, and I'll take you there
Tell me how you want to feel, don't keep it from me
Tell me how it outta be through more than a stare
Show me what you wanna be, don't hide it from me
Show me where you wanna be, and I'll take you there
Show me how you want to feel, don't keep it from me
Show me how it outta be through more than a stare

I just want to see you
And I just want to hear you
And I just need to feel you
So stand up

Tell me who you are
Tell me where you want to be
Tell me how you feel
Show me how it outta be
Take a little piece of me and hang it from the right tree
Share a little piece of me and I'll keep you as a part of me

You are my all
You are my everything

Who are you, you're my everything
