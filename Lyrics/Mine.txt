'Ey man
Nice shoes
Nice car
Nice rock

You got a nice girl too
And this one could be mine
I'm gonna take her from you
I'm gonna take her from you

'Ey gentleman
Nice suits
Nice desk
Nice situation

You got a nice wife too
Now this one could be mine
I'm gonna take her from you
I'm gonna take her from you

Hey president
Nice country
Nice cities
Nice clouds

You got a nice army too
And this, it could be mine
I'm gonna take it from you
I'm gonna take it from you
