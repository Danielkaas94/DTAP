I took a little journey to the unknown
And I've come back changed, I can feel it in my bones
I fucked with forces that our eyes can't see
Now the darkness got a hold on me
Oh, the darkness got a hold on me

How long baby have I been away?
Oh, it feels like ages, though you say it's only days
There ain't language for the things I've seen, yeah
And the truth is stranger than my own worst dreams
The truth is stranger than all my dreams
Oh, the darkness got a hold on me

I have seen what the darkness does
Say goodbye to who I was
I ain't never been away so long
Don't look back, them days are gone
Follow me into the endless night
I can bring your fears to life
Show me yours and I'll show you mine
Meet me in the woods tonight

The truth is stranger than my own worst dreams
Oh, the darkness got a hold on me

I have seen what the darkness does
Say goodbye to who I was
I ain't never been away so long
Don't look back, them days are gone
Follow me into the endless night
I can bring your fears to life
Show me yours and I'll show you mine
Meet me in the woods tonight
