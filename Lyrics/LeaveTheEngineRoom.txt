Baby gets born, rolls on his back, opens his eyes
And hears a voice a-saying oh-oh-oh-oh
I'll tell you a secret about yourself
I'll tell you a secret about yourself

Your father was bad, his father was bad, his father was bad
Need I go any further on?
You're not gonna try to involve yourself
Your pliable head is a walking hope

'Cause even now
There's a bone snapping
Doughy embryo
Bloody hands clapping
The blood is clapping

If all the boys say you did it
And all the girls say you did it
And if all the boys say you did it
And all the girls say you did it

Then man, you're as guilty as
The ones that came before
You sleepwalked over here
The drawbridge creaks ignored

Leave the engine room and go
Leave the engine room and build a road
Leave the engine room
The steam will peter out

And I'm tired of the centuries passing
The vacuum and the womb
And I respect that things have changed
And I'm alone

And I remember the snatches here
And I involve myself with utter madness
Leave me lounging

With my nerves butchered and the ceiling torched
In the birth canal, 'cause even now
There's a bomb dropping
It's ever dropping

'Cause all the boys say I did it
And all the girls say I did it
And mother, all the boys say I did it
Hm, and all the girls say I did it

And man, I'm as guilty as
The ones that came before
