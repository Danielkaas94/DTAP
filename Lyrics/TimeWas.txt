I've got to rearrange my life
I've got to rearrange my world
I miss you, I need you
I've got to keep my memories aside
I've got to try to live again

Time was, when there were things around to be afraid of
I've got cause, I've even changed my mind to turn the tables
Time was, there was no need to stop and rearrange it
Now I've got, a memory, and I don't want to change it

And there's a time for waking up and feeling down
It's when you have to pick your feet up from the ground

Time was, when I had you around I was a strong man
I need you to help make the change and be a new man

Takes more than a day and a night for giving
It's not so easy to just change your way of living

Time was when there were things around to bother me
The crime was, I couldn't start to change my history
