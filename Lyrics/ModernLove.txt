Hey, I'm feeling so dirty, you're looking so clean
And all you can give is a spin in your washing machine
I fly off to Rome to my prima bella
She leaves me in the rain with telescopic umbrella

Aah the pain
Modern love can be a strain
Aah the pain
Modern love can be a strain

I trusted my Venus was untouched in her shell
But the pearls and the balls in her oysters were tacky as hell
For Lady Godiva I came incognito
The driver had stolen her red hot magneto

Aah the pain
Modern love can be a strain
Aah the pain
Modern love can be a strain

I don't know why they leave me in the lurch
To carry on the search
It's driving me up the wall
When I have so much passion
Romance is out of fashion
Can't handle modern love at all

Hey, I worship Diana by the light of the moon
When I pull out my pipe she scream out of tune
In Paris my heart sinks when I see my Mona Lisa
She gives me the wink, then she shows me the freezer

Aah the pain
Modern love can be a strain
Aah the pain
Modern love can be a strain

Aah the pain
Ooh the pain
Aah the pain
Ooh, ooh
Gimme the pain
Ooh, the pain
