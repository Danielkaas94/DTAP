Knock on the door and the door knocks back
The joke never go no further than that
Fire goes back inside the match
Back down the stack

And we hustle and cuss
Lick on the dust
Hustle and cuss
Lick on the dust
Hustle and cuss
Lick on the dust

And we hustle and cuss
Hustle and cuss and lick on the dust
Hustle and cuss
Hustle and cuss and lick on the dust
Must you muscle and fuss?
You muscle and fuss
And lick on the dust
Hustle and cuss
Hustle and cuss and lick on the dust

When we were young
A different kind of fun
Playing in the mud
It meant something else
Now we hustle and cuss
Hustle and cuss

And we hustle and cuss
Hustle and cuss and lick on the dust
Hustle and cuss
Hustle and cuss and lick on the dust

Must we muscle and fuss?
You muscle and fuss
And lick on the dust
Hustle and cuss
Hustle and cuss and lick on the dust

You're easy to fool and easy to catch
And I don't know if I want you to
Match my bets

And we hustle and cuss
Lick on the dust
Hustle and cuss
Lick on the dust

And we hustle and cuss
Hustle and cuss and lick on the dust
Hustle and cuss
Hustle and cuss and lick on the dust

Must you muscle and fuss?
Hustle and cuss
Muscle and fuss
Muscle and fuss
And lick on the dust
