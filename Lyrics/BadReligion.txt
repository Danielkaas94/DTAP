Get back!

Can you feel I'm not like you anymore?
I can't see, I can't breathe
See you quiver like the dogs on the streets
Looking down on as I beat you

Oh, it's a bad religion
From a broken nation
It's a contradiction
And I can't take it anymore, yeah

Who's to say I won't like you anyway?
Take a deep breath, I'm alive
Can you hear me?
I'm alive inside of you
Agony creeps up behind you

Oh, it's a bad religion (bad religion)
From a broken nation (a broken nation)
It's a contradiction
And I can't take it any fucking way
(It's a bad religion, bad religion, bad religion)
From a broken nation (a broken nation)
It's a contradiction, yeah

Can you feel it?
I gotta live with it everyday
And I can't take the pressure
I'm going insane, now go away

Go away
