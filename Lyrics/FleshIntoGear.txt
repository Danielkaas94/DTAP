I can't expect you to see
Me when I'm not around
And my voice is destroyed
By confinement of sound
I'm a human machine
Laced with hidden disease
If the future is bleak
Then you're connected to me

Flesh into gear
Myself appears dissected and pretentious
A simple sound a heavy sigh
Could win the whole world over
You live in fear of being someone that you didn't want to
I realize your insecurity will get the best of you

A traitor's embrace
How foolish how wrong
Contained in one place
Anxiety spawns
Unopened reowned
What's needed upscaled
Digested inhaled
Unwilling unwound

Flesh into gear
Myself appears dissected and pretentious
A simple sound a heavy sigh
Could win the whole world over
You live in fear of being someone that you didn't want to
I realize your insecurity will get the best of you
