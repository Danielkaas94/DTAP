Do you remember?
Chalk hearts melting on a playground wall
Do you remember?
Dawn escapes from moon washed college halls
Do you remember?
The cherry blossom in the market square
Do you remember?
I thought it was confetti in our hair

By the way, didn't I break your heart?
Please excuse me, I never meant to break your heart
So sorry, I never meant to break your heart
But you broke mine

Kayleigh, is it too late to say I'm sorry?
And, Kayleigh, could we get it together again?
I just can't go on pretending
That it came to a natural end
Kayleigh, oh I never thought I'd miss you
And, Kayleigh, I thought that we'd always be friends
We said our love would last forever
So how did it come to this bitter end?

(Oh, yeah)

Do you remember?
Barefoot on the lawn with shooting stars
Do you remember?
The loving on the floor in Belsize Park
Do you remember?
Dancing in stilettoes in the snow
Do you remember?
You never understood I had to go

By the way, didn't I break your heart?
Please excuse me, I never meant to break your heart
So sorry, I never meant to break your heart
But you broke mine

Kayleigh, I just want to say I'm sorry
But, Kayleigh, I'm too scared to pick up the phone
To hear you've found another lover
To patch up our broken home
Kayleigh, I'm still trying to write that love song
Kayleigh, it's more important to me, now you're gone
Maybe it will prove that we were right
Or it'll prove that I was wrong
