I wake up exhausted, it's not mornin'
It's back to sleep to re-dream me
We're alone and we're happy
But there you are angry with me

Are you alright? I can stand up straight
Are you alright, can you get me off your mind?

I hated this city before you came here
So let go and move on
We're strangers, we're not friends
I hate this and I hate them

This city's exhausted and it's wound up
Soon to be a place that's just filled up
And I found out that you're angry
And you're sorry you ever met me

Are you alright? I can stand up straight
Are you alright, can you get me off your mind?
I am alright I can stand up straight
Are you alright, can you get me off your mind?

I wake up exhausted, it's not mornin'
It's back to sleep to re-dream me
We're alone and we're happy
But there you are angry with me

Are you alright? I can stand up straight
Are you alright? I can you get you off my mind
I am alright, I can stand up straight
Are you alright, can you get me off your mind?
Can you get me off your mind?

Can you get me off your mind?
Can you get me off your mind?
Can you get me off your mind?
