Sell your soul
Sell your soul he will swallow it whole
Sell your soul
Sell your soul he will swallow your soul

(Betrayer)
(Betrayer)

Betrayer, blind to faith blinding followers
Spreading deception like a plague through their veins
Pumping hell in their hearts
Betrayed by the father

Ravenous disease (ravenous disease)
Man is the carrier

A broken moral compass
Charting the course for generations of sorrow
A life void of substance
A future so bleak we look ahead with horror
Horror

Fallen from grace
Deeper we sink
A great pit within the earth
Swallowing the weak

Fallen from grace
Deeper we sink
A great pit within the earth
Swallowing the weak

Whispers of demons
Ringing in the ears of the crowd
Impressionable youth
Sing every word
Spewing from their wretched mouths

A broken moral compass
Charting the course for generations of sorrow
A life void of substance
A future so bleak we look ahead with horror
Horror

(Man is the carrier)

Sell your soul
Sell your soul he will swallow it whole
Sell your soul
Sell your soul he will swallow your soul

There will be hell to pay
Fallen from grace
Deeper we sink
Fallen from grace
Deeper we sink
