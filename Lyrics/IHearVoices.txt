I feel the pressure
Pushing down on me
Can't face the world
Can't change the things I see
I got my hands in my pockets
Staring at the walls
Can nobody help me
To escape from it all

I hear voices in my head
They taunt me
Can't lock them out
Inside my thoughts
They breathe in me
I got my hands in my pockets
Screaming at the walls
Can nobody help me
To escape from it all

I've got to run to be free
Break the chains round my heart
Take away the pain and the joy
Release the man from the boy
Run to be free, run from the heart
Life will take you where it goes

You can offer me salvation
Feed me when I call
Don't talk to me of sanity
When I'm not quite here at all

I've touched the sun
I felt its warmth in me
So you will never take away my dignity
Cause I've got my hands in my pockets
Fighting for my cause
Can nobody help me
To escape from it all

Run to be free
Break the chains round my heart
Life will take you where it goes
Run to be free
Run from the heart
