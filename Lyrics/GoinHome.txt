Goin' home, goin' home
I'm just goin' home
Quiet like sun, still day
I'm just goin' home
It's not far, just close by
Through an open door
Work all done, care laid by
Goin' to fear no more

Mother's there, expecting me
Father's waiting too
Lots of folk gathered there
All the friends I knew
All the friends I knew

Nothing's lost, all's gain
No more fret nor pain
No more stumbling on the way
No more longing for the day
Goin' to roam no more

Morning star lights the way
Restless dream all done
Shadows gone, break of day
Real life just begun
There's no break, there's no end
Just a living on
Wide awake with a smile
Goin' on and on

Goin' home, goin' home
I'm just goin' home
It's not far, just close by
Through an open door
Through an open door
I'm just goin' home
