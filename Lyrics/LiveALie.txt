I can feel the blood rushing to my eyes
Waking up in mud, you left me to die
My heart turned cold December 29
30 and below, the day that hell froze
How did I survive? Blame it on my soul
Fire in the hole
You turned your back on me
It's clear you're someone I don't even know
Being naive to jealousy can poison anybody soul
Ending this chapter of my life without a funeral
So grab another shovel, dig another hole

Oh my, dark times
Feel my rage, deep inside
To survive, I can't live a lie
To survive, I can't live a lie
Oh my, dark times
Feel my rage, deep inside
To survive, I can't live a lie
To survive, I can't live a lie

My severed veins, full of rage
Draining blood off the fucking page
Angel on my shoulder, devil on my case
But my anxiety, I can't escape
I feel alive, but something's strange
I'm scarred for life, but where's the pain?
Recognize your face, forgot your name
People come and go, that's a common thang
Playing the game, people will change
You think you know someone, they're probably fake
People will lie, straight to your face
Look in the mirror, they can't relate
Neither can I, I'm out of place
I trust myself, people can wait
Despite it all, my faith remains
Jesus was crucified, nobody changed

Oh my, dark times
Feel my rage, deep inside
To survive, I can't live a lie
To survive, I can't live a lie
Oh my, dark times
Feel my rage, deep inside
To survive, I can't live a lie
To survive, I can't live a lie

I can't live a lie
I can't live a lie
I can't live a lie
I can't live a lie

To survive, I can't live a lie
To survive, I can't live a lie
To survive, I can't live a lie
To survive, I can't live a lie
