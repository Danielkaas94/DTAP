We stand together like brothers
Under troubled sky
So crazy how we came to live this life
Cross my heart but I refuse to die
I'm coming home to you

They never gave us any guarantee
All they want to see is bravery
I can't live with this misery
I'm coming home to you

And I don't know
Who's on whose side
Guide me with your love

Give me the light of a thousand stars
Shine my way back to you
Show me the road
Get me over the line
There's no limit to what love can do

Don't need no badge of honour
On my sleeve
The fear of dying gonna set me free
A part of you is still a part of me
I'm coming home to you

'Cos I keep your picture
Close to my heart
You're the sweetest thing in this life
And if I ever get back home
I'm gonna fight to
Keep our dream alive

You know that men are born
And men will die
I look at what I am surrounded by
Gotta get out before I lose my mind
I'm coming home
