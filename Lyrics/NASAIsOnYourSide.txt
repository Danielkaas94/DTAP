 awake in the future, I have turned to stone with fear
Laid on petrified trees, oh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
In a high school massacre, I'm fossilized and clear
The teenage terrorists freeze, oh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

We began dismantling the stadia and schools
Singing, "Save our simian souls", oh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Polished up warm bullets hanging static in the air
Droplets glittering home, oh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

NASA knows how the pheromones
Cascade down the walls
You can't help the way you feel
You're the crudest oil, let your vision boil
Yeah, they're gonna dig a coal-face out of you
Isambard, I'm all steel

Chasing homeless cheerleaders through the sewers lit
By burning polythene bags (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Pushing flame scorched limos to the oil rig tonight
For the promenade dance (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)

Fill your locker with an arsenal
Hieroglyphic every particle
Mother all about the coal and the lava and the gas that we are
Lovers on the landfill digging me up to fuel rockets and risk
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, they'll save us)

Look across now, honey, the horizon
I can see a shuttle birth, is it a boy? Or a girl? Or a gun?
I know it's ludicrous to be lost
There's never been a time like this
Oh-oh-oh-oh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

Everyone is gonna end up there
You're overcome, but NASA is on your side
And it's happening, the sky is shattering
And they're gonna make a Death Star out of you
But NASA is on your side
Yeah, NASA is on your side
Yeah, NASA is on your side

NASA is on your side
NASA is on your side

And everyone is gonna end up there
You're overcome, but NASA is on your side
Yeah, NASA is on your side
Yeah, NASA is on your side

There were children climbing over fridges in a rush
To see the death of the sun, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
And we laughed all night when they said, "Treasure in the sky"
And we had nothing but fun, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
