How can I decide what's right? 
When you're clouding up my mind 
I can't win your losing fight all the time 
How can I ever own what's mine 
When you're always taking sides 
But you won't take away my pride 
No not this time 
Not this time 

How did we get here? 
Well I used to know you so well
How did we get here? 
Well I think I know 

The truth is hiding in your eyes 
And its hanging on your tongue 
Just boiling in my blood
But you think that I can't see 
What kind of man that you are 
If you're a man at all 
Well I will figure this one out 
On my own 
I'm screaming, I love you so
On my own 
My thoughts you can't decode

How did we get here? 
Well I used to know you so well, yeah
How did we get here? 
Well I think I know 

Do you see what we've done? 
We've gone and made such fools of ourselves 
Do you see what we've done? 
We've gone and made such fools of ourselves 

Yeah

How did we get here? 
Well I used to know you so well, yeah yeah
How did we get here? 
Well I used to know you so well 

I think I know 
I think I know 

Ooh, there is something 
I see in you 
It might kill me 
I want it to be true
