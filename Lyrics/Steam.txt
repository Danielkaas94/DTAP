Stand Back
Said stand Back
What are those dogs doing sniffing at my feet?
They're on to something, picking up, picking up this heat

This heat, give me steam
And how you feel can make it real
Real as anything you've seen
Get a life with the dreamer's dream

You know your culture from your trash
You know your plastic from your cash
When I lose sight of the track
You know the way back, but I know you

You know your stripper from your paint
You know your sinner from your saint
Whenever heaven's doors are shut
You kick them open, but I know you

Give me steam
And how you feel can make it real
Real as any place you've been
Get a life with the dreamer's dream

Stand back
Said stand back
Can't you see I've lost control I'm getting indiscreet?
You're moving in so close 'til I'm picking up, picking up this heat

This heat, give me steam
And how you feel can make it real
Real as anything you've seen
Get a life with the dreamer's dream

You know your green from your red
You know the quick from the dead
So much better than the rest
You think you've been blessed, but I know you

You know your ladder from your snake
You know the throttle from the brake
You know your straight line from a curve
You've got a lot of nerve, but I know you

Give me steam
And how you feel can make it real
Real as any place you've been
Get a life with the dreamer's dream

Everybody nosedive
Hold your breath, count to five
Backslap, booby-trap
Cover it up in bubble-wrap
Room shake, earthquake
Find a way to stay awake
It's going to blow, it's going to break
This is more than I can take

Oh yeah, I need steam
Feel the steam around me
Ah, you're turning up the heat
When I start to dream aloud
See you move your hands and feet
Won't you step into this cloud of steam?
This steam

Give me steam
And how you feel can make it real
Real as anything you've seen
Get a life with the dreamer's dream

Help me, yeah
Ready to steam out the log jam
Stir crazy from the freezer to the foil
Water's bubbling, it's b-b-b-bubbling
Bubbling, bubbling, bubbling, bubbling
Like it's coming to a boil
Give me steam, lady
Give me steam around me now
Coming alive
Coming alive
Said give me some steam
