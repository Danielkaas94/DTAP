I stand on the brink of your mind
Living inside a nightmare from which
I just cannot awaken
Stand on the edge of your life
Just give me another moment
From which I will never awaken

Stand on the brink of my own demise
Fallen again for another
Mistress of burden to idolize

Hoping that one of them will decide
To let me in

(My mistress)

To stand on the edge of the knife
Cutting through the nightmare from which
I just cannot awaken
Stand on the edge of the knife
Living inside a moment
From which I will never awaken

Stand on the brink of my own demise
Fallen again for another
Mistress of burden to idolize
Hoping that one of them will decide
To let me in

Look at what you've done to me

You've become my enemy
Poisoning the world for me
Take away my everything
Weakened as I am

(Never)
Awaken
Stand on the brink of my own demise
Fallen again for another
Mistress of burden to idolize

Hoping that one of them will decide
To let me in (My mistress)
Decide to let me in (My mistress)
Decide to let me in
