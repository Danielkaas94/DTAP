Blackstar
Blackstar

You must have wished on it
Because I saw them riding in on a Blackstar
They'd rather chew than spit
And they're full of piss and vinegar

There's no way to persuade, them to give up their crusade
They've come to grant the wish, you should have never made
Sing Hallelujah because you can't change anything
They'll let you try
To reverse everything
Don't waste your time
Sing Hallelujah because you can't change anything

They move without a sound
And their eyes will paralyze who gaze into
They'll leave you gagged and bound
To the whip of the wish they've granted you

There's no way to persuade, them to give up their crusade
They've come to grant the wish, you should have never made
Sing Hallelujah because you can't change anything
They'll let you try
To reverse everything
Don't waste your time
Sing Hallelujah because you can't change anything

Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah ...

Looks like they're over it
I saw them riding off on a Blackstar
With nothing left to chew, they split
Because it makes no difference who you are

They'll let you try
To reverse everything
Don't waste your time
Sing Hallelujah cause you can't change anything
They'll let you try
To reverse everything
Don't waste your time
Sing Hallelujah cause you can't change anything
Sing Hallelujah cause you can't change anything
Sing Hallelujah cause you can't change anything
