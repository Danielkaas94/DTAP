Hey Mac sit down without Dolce Vita
"Get back, we don't have time"
"'Cos I hear we're sending off the heroes
When the year goes, they're out of the bay
Trying to find a way
To make it alive"

"So long", said four men to their families
"Be strong, 'till we get back home
And if not, take care of all the children
Until then just hope and pray
We're gonna find a way
To make it alive

You guys are crazy

They shout and then we leave the harbour
In doubt, they're acting weird
And the sea is whipping up a welcome
If hell come we're all easy prey
Trying to find a way
To make it alive

"You guys are crazy!"

The captain's hand shook for the guys to get in place
He said Let's look behind your face
With each corner covered, they were all around
Waiting for the midnight bell to sound

"Out of sight", cried Aeron through his glasses
"Don't fight", said Gorham's smile
All the while, his hand was on my shoulder
I was scared of being easy prey
Trying to find a way
To make it alive

I won't be easy prey
Gonna find a way
To make it alive
