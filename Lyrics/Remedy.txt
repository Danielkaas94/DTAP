Baby, baby, why can't you sit still?
Who killed that bird out on your window sill?
Are you the reason that he broke his back?
Tell me, did I see you baby laugh about that?

If I come on like a dream?
Will you let me show you what I mean?
Will you let me come on inside?
Will you let it glide?

Can I have some remedy? (All I want is a remedy)
Remedy for me, please (for all of the things I really do need)
If I'd some remedy (ooh, I'd take another one)
I'd take enough to please me

Baby, baby, why you dye your hair?
Why you always keeping with your mother's dare?
So, baby, why's who's who? Oh, babe, I know you too
Tell me, did the other children scold on you?

If I come on like a dream?
Ooh, will you let me show you what I mean?
Will you let me come on inside?
Oh, will you let it slide?

Can I have some remedy? (All I want is a remedy)
Remedy for me, please (for all of the things I really do need)
If I'd some remedy (I'd surely take another)
I'd take enough to please me

I need a remedy, huh, yeah, but what is havin' me?
You see, huh, I need a remedy, but what is havin' me?
I need a remedy, yeah, but what is havin' me?
If I'd only had a remedy, you see, I'll find it
You see, baby, I want it, you see, I'll find it
Oh, I really want, really want it
Can I have some remedy?
Remedy for me, please
If I'd some remedy
I'd take enough to please me
