I'm in a freefall, like a snowflake falling,
Down, down, down, down, down.
I close my eyes inside my head I starfall
Helpless to the ground.
Down, down, down, down, down, oh yeah.

Smoke rings around me and bright sparks of fire
Flash by as I go.
I've got the feeling and it takes me higher
Than I'll ever know.
Go, go, go, go, go. Oooh.
