Life is so fragile
Like a trembling leaf
Time passes slower
With each day of misery

Things aren't so bad

Hey, can you heal me? (can you heal me?)
Hey, hey listen to me (listen to me)
Time fell down my crippled well
And I get what I deserve
Hey, hey listen to me

Focus on your pain
Nothing else remains
How would you answer
If I did the same?

Things aren't so bad

Hey, can you heal me? (can you heal me?)
Hey, hey listen to me (listen to me)
Time fell down my crippled well
And I get what I deserve
Hey, hey listen to me

I get what I deserved, yeah
I get what I deserved, yeah

Before I cut my skin
You need to look deeper within

Hey, can you heal me? (can you heal me?)
Hey, hey listen to me (listen to me)
Time fell down my crippled well
And I get what I deserve
Hey, hey listen to me
