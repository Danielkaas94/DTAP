I have worked for nothing, slaved in vain
All those years that I've been pushed around
They better watch their backs now, those who gave me pain
'Cause vengeance screams their names tonight

All of you sinners
You better run and try to hide
You've all been dreaming
So you better hide to stay alive

Marching out now, out to kill
The rain of blood has just begun
Blocked emotions now released
In darkness wou will fear my name
All of you sinners
You better run and try to hide
You've all been dreaming
So you better hide to stay alive
All of you sinners

Can you hear me?
I'm closing in on you
Can't you fell it...

I will show no mercy wou will not survive
'Cause vengeance screams your names tonight

All of you sinners
You better run and try to hide
You've all been dreaming
So you better hide to stay alive
