I won't give up on you
If you will never give up on me
Anytime that you're off the beat
I'll put you on the groove and in key

I'm following you
If you are always following me
Any time that you hum it wrong
I'll help you sing the right melody
It goes

La la la, la la la-la-la
La la la, la la la-la-la
Ooh, ooh
That's how it goes

If things go bad for you
Then things are going bad for me
We're in this thing together
I couldn't think of a better team

And when the world gets heavy
The weight has got you down on your knees
It's okay to say F it
If you just remember this melody
It goes

La la la, la la la-la-la
La la la, la la la-la-la
Ooh, ooh
It goes
La la la, la la la-la-la
La la la, la la la-la-la
Ooh, ooh
That's how it goes

When the clouds above your head
And the sun's not breaking through
You know I'll be there to sing this song for you
And it goes

La la la, la la la-la-la
La la la, la la la-la-la
Oh, that's how it goes

La la la, la la la-la-la (That's how it goes)
La la la, la la la-la-la (That's how it goes)
La la la, la la la-la-la (That's how it goes)
La la la, la la la-la-la (That's how it goes)
La la la, la la la-la-la (That's how it goes)
La la la, la la la-la-la (That's how it goes)
