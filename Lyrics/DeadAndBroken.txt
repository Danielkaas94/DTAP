Too many things I've never spoken
I'm not feeling fine
I never told you what to do
I never made you a promise that you could hold me to
And that'll be the day you see me crying

Every day I still say you're dead and broken
Every day I still say you're dead and broken
You're dead and broken

How many different faces can you show me?
How many times can you be right?
Another world of fantasy
Another reason for dramatizing everything
Takin' it all in just one more time
I'm dying!

Every day I still say you're dead and broken
Every day I still say you're dead and broken
You're dead and broken

Sorry to see
That you're underestimated lately
I'd rather be
Dead and broken than living in your grace

Every day I still say you're dead and broken
Every day I still say you're dead and broken

You're dead and broken
You're dead and broken
You're dead and broken
You're dead and broken
You're dead and broken
You're dead and broken
You're dead and broken
