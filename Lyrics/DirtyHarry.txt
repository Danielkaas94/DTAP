I need a gun to keep myself among
The poor people are burning in the sun
But they ain't got a chance, they ain't got a chance
I need a gun 'cause all I do is dance
'Cause all I do is dance

I need a gun to keep myself among
The poor people are burning in the sun
But they ain't got a chance, they ain't got a chance
I need a gun 'cause all I do is dance
'Cause all I do is dance

In my backpack, I got my act right
In case you act quite difficult
And your result weaken with anger and discontent
Some are seeking and in search of like Nimoy

I'm a peace-loving decoy, ready for retaliation
I change your whole location to a pine box six-under
Impulsive, don't ask why or wonder
Orders given to me is strike
And I'm thunder with lightning-fast reflexes on constant alert
From the constant hurt that seems limitless with no drop in pressure
It seems like everybody's out to take ya' 'til they see you break
You can't conceal the hate that consumes you
I'm the reason why you fill up your Isuzu

Chill with your old lady at the tilt, I got a 90-day extension
And I'm filled with guilt from things that I've seen
Your water's from a bottle, mine's from a canteen
At night, I hear the shots ring, so I'm a light sleeper
The cost of life, it seem to get cheaper

Out in the desert with my street sweeper
"The war is over", so said the speaker
With the flight suit on
Maybe to him, I'm just a pawn
So he can advance
Remember when I used to dance

Man, all I wanna do is dance
(Dance)
(Dance)
(Dance)
I need a gun to keep myself among
