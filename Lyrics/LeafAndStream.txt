Find myself beside a stream of empty thought
Like a leaf that's fallen to the ground
Carried by the flow of water to my dreams
And woken only by your sound

Alone I've walked this path for many years
Listened to the wind that calls my name
The weeping trees of yesterday that look so sad
Await your breath of spring again

Far beyond the hills where earth and sky will meet again
Are shadows like an opening hand
Control the secrets that I've yet to find and wonder at
The light in which they stand

Find myself beside a stream of empty thought
Like a leaf that's fallen to the ground
And carried by the flow of water to my dreams
And woken only by your sound

Far beyond the hills where earth and sky will meet again
Are shadows like an opening hand
Control the secrets that I've yet to find and wonder at
The light in which they stand
