There is illusion in my mirror
I have to show concern
'Cos what is left is right
Don't know which way to turn
And there is someone who is like me
But all they want to do is stare
And he would like to find the key
But I'm not there

Shadow, nothing but a shadow
Sunlight, never see the sunlight
Power, I got a special power
Shadow, nothing but a shadow

And now I'm moving
Down the sidewalk
Just staring at the ground
And if I don't look up the scene
Will change around
And we are residents of nowhere
What do we really say
Like a marionette just
Acting out a play

I thought I saw a face that I knew
While running through the crowd
Then she turned to look at me
I didn't really feel a thing
Just floating through the air
A trick of light for all to see
