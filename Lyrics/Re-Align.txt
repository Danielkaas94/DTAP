Decisions made from desperation
No way to go
Internal instincts craving isolation
For me to grow

My fears come alive
In this place where I once died
Demons dreaming
Knowing I, I just needed to realign

Fell in a river of illusion
And apathy
Drowning in a self-induced confusion
I'd rather be, yeah

My fears come alive
In this place where I once died
Demons dreaming
Knowing I, I just needed to realign

My fears come alive
In this place where I once died
Demons dreaming
Knowing I, I just needed to realign, yeah

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

My fears come alive
In this place where I once died
Demons dreaming
Knowing I, I just needed to realign

My fears come alive
In this place where I once died
Demons dreaming
Knowing I, I just needed to realign, yeah
