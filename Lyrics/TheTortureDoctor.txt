The torture doctor is in
Back here to confess his sins
Knowing damn well he was dead wrong
And I can't believe my eyes
Trouble and regret haunt my mind
I'll let you take the whole thing down brick by brick
Tonight

And there's a devil dancing in my head
As I'm hovering above your bed

Hey, ho
We know how this story goes
Hey, ho
The plot it thickens and grows
Hey, ho
There's nothing left to hide
Hey, ho
Down here on the south side

I was the worst of my kind
I left me old life behind
Can't believe I got away with it so long
At the end of the day
There is nothing to say
So tired of being wired wrong
All my life

And there's a devil dancing in my head
As I'm hovering above your bed

Hey, ho
We know how this story goes
Hey, ho
The plot it thickens and grows
Hey, ho
There's nothing left to hide
Hey, ho
Down here on the south side
Down on the south side

Hey, ho
We know how this story goes
Hey, ho
The plot it thickens and grows
Hey, ho
There's nothing left to hide
Hey, ho
Down here on the south side
Down on the south side
Down on the south side
