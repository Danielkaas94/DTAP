Can't remember my name
Can't remember at all
Finding you from past times, I think
How did we ever fall? Yeah

Never knowing the answers
Calling myself names
Now is not the question for us
Will it ever be again?

Why don't you just fly?
Fly to me!
And how long
How long will you wait for me?
Never

Now or never again
Now or never again

Feel me up inside you
How you quiver and shake
Can I rape you back to my life?
Will you trust me again?

Now or never
And I'll never let you down
So fly to me!
And how long
How long can I wait?

Why don't you just fly?
Fly to me!
And how long
How long will you wait for me?
Never

Now or never
Now or never
Never, never, never
Now or never
Never again
Never, never, never
Now or never
Never again

Fly, fly, fly
Fly, fly, fly, yeah

Why don't you just fly?
Fly to me!
And how long
How long will you wait for me?

Now or never, never again
Now or never, never again
Now or never, never again
Now or never, never, never again
Never again, never
