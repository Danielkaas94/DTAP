Home, it's becoming a killing field
There's a crosshair locked on my heart
With no recourse, and there's no one behind the wheel
Hellfire, you're wiping me out, killed by

Drones!
Killed by
Drones!
Killed by

You rule with lies and deceit
And the world is on your side
You've got the CIA, babe
And all you've done is brutalise

Drones!

War, war just moved up a gear
I don't think I can handle the truth
I'm just a pawn, and we're all expendable
Incidentally electronically erased by your

Drones!
Killed by
Drones!
Killed by

You kill by remote control
And the world is on your side
You've got reapers and hawks, babe
And now I am radicalised

Drones!
Killed by

(You can run, but you're never gonna hide)
(You can run, but you're never gonna, gonna, gonna)
(You can run, but you're never gonna hide)
(You can run, but you're never-)

You rule with lies and deceit
And the world is on your side
You've got the CIA, babe
And all you've done is brutalise

You kill by remote control
And the world is on your side
You've got reapers and hawks, babe
And now I am radicalised

Here come the drones!
Here come the drones!
Here come the drones!
