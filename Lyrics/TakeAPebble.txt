Just take a pebble
And cast it to the sea
Then watch the ripples
That unfold into me

My face spills so gently
Into your eyes
Disturbing the waters
Of our lives

Shreds of our memories
Are lying on your grass
Wounded words of laughter
Are graveyards of the past
Photographs are grey and torn
Scattered in your fields
Letters of your memories
Are not real

Wear sadness on your shoulders
Like a worn-out overcoat
In pockets creased and tattered
Hang the rags of your hopes
The daybreak is your midnight
The colours have all died
Disturbing the waters
Of our lives
Of our lives
Of our lives, lives, lives, lives
Of our lives
