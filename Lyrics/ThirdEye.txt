[Spoken by Bill Hicks:]
"See, I think drugs have done some good things for us, I really do
And if you don't believe drugs have done good things for us, do me a favor
Go home tonight and take all your albums, all your tapes, and all your CDs and burn 'em
'Cause you know what? The musicians who've made all that great music
That's enhanced your lives throughout the years?
Real fucking high on drugs"



Today young men on acid realise that all matter is purely energy condensed into a slow vibration, 
that we are all one consciousness experiencing itself subjectively. There is no such thing as death. 
Life is only a dream and we are the imagination of ourselves. Here's Tom with the weather.

It's not a war on drugs, it's a war on personal freedom is what it is, OK. Keep that in mind at all times. Thank you.

Dreaming of that face again.
It's bright and blue and shimmering.
Grinning wide
And comforting me with its three warm and wild eyes.

On my back and tumbling
Down that hole and back again
Rising up
And wiping the webs and the dew from my withered eye.

In... out... in... out... in... out...

A child's rhyme stuck in my head.
It said that life is but a dream.
I've spent so many years in question
to find I've known this all along.

"So good to see you.
I've missed you so much.
So glad it's over.
I've missed you so much
Came out to watch you play.
Why are you running away?
Came out to watch you play.
Why are you running?"

Shrouding all the ground around me
Is this holy crow above me.
Black as holes within a memory
And blue as our new second sun.
I stick my hand into the shadow
To pull the pieces from the sand.
Which I attempt to reassemble
To see just who I might have been.
I do not recognize the vessel,
But the eyes seem so familiar.
Like phosphorescent desert buttons
Singing one familiar song...

"So good to see you.
I've missed you so much.
So glad it's over.
I've missed you so much.
Came out to watch you play.
Why are you running away?"

Prying open my third eye.
Prying open my third eye.
Prying open my third eye.
Prying open my third eye.

So good to see you once again.
I thought that you were hiding.
And you thought that I had run away.
Chasing the tail of dogma.

I opened my eye
I opened my eye
I opened my eye
I opened my eye and there we were.

I opened my eye
I opened my eye
I opened my eye
I opened my eye and there we were.

So good to see you once again
I thought that you were hiding from me.
you thought that I had run away.
Chasing a trail of smoke and the reason.

Prying open my third eye.
