Bold motherfucker don't you limit your mind

Liberate your mind
You motherfucker, you're so narrow-minded
So narrow-minded
So liberate your mind
Now motherfucker, will you liberate your mind (Hey, hey)
Liberate your mind
You motherfucker, you're so narrow-minded
So narrow-minded
So liberate your mind
Now motherfucker, will you liberate your mind
This time

Bold motherfucker, don't you limit your mind
Can't you see that the message has fallen behind?
All the hate in your heart will be leaving you blind
So bold motherfucker, don't you limit your mind

Now bold motherfucker, don't you limit your mind
Can't you see that the message has fallen behind?
All the hate in your heart will be leaving you blind
So bold motherfucker, don't you limit your mind
This time

Waiting, for your modern messiah
To take away all the hatred
That darkens the light in your eye
Still awaiting I

Liberate your mind
You motherfucker, you're so narrow-minded
So narrow-minded
So liberate your mind
Now motherfucker, will you liberate your mind (Hey, hey)
Liberate your mind
You motherfucker, you're so narrow-minded
So narrow-minded
So liberate your mind
Now motherfucker, will you liberate your mind
This time

Bold motherfucker, don't you limit your mind
Can't you see that the message has fallen behind?
All the hate in your heart will be leaving you blind
So bold motherfucker, don't you limit your mind

Now bold motherfucker, don't you limit your mind
Can't you see that the message has fallen behind
All the hate in your heart will be leaving you blind
So bold motherfucker, don't you limit your mind
This time

Waiting, for your modern messiah
To take away all the hatred
That darkens the light in your eye
Still awaiting I

"Out of Zion shall come forth a law
And the word of the Lord from Jerusalem
Nation shall not raise sword against nation
And they shall not learn war anymore
For the mouth of the Lord hath spoken"

Waiting, for your modern messiah
To take away all the hatred
That darkens the light in your eye

How long will we be
Waiting, for your modern messiah
To take away all the hatred
That darkens the light in your eye

Still awaiting I
Still awaiting I
