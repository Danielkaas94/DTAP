Hello, hi, I'm a 2019 guy
I don't need drugs to get high
I have Soylent and wine

I respect girls by getting friend zoned and denied
I think about them and cry
I am totally fine

Testosterone's low, feelings high
That's how you know I'm truly 2019 Guy

My dick's not big, my girlfriend fucked my friend
You say I'm down on my luck, I say it's a win-win
'Cause I'm a cuck

And I hope he fucks her good
In a way, I wish I could
I just want to watch!

Hello, hi, I'm a 2019 guy
I think science is a lie
I am offended online

I'm fragile and shy
I don't really go outside
I don't have friends that's why I am offended all the time

My dick's not big, my girlfriend fucked my friend
You say I'm down on my luck, I say it's a win-win
'Cause I'm a cuck

And I hope he fucks her good
In a way, I wish I could

His dick's not big, so I fucked his friend
I say he's down on his luck, he says it's a win-win
'Cause I'm a cuck

And I hope he fucks her good
In a way, I wish I could
I just want to watch!
