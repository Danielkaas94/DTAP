Don't turn away
I pray you've heard the words I've spoken

Dare to believe
Oh, for one last time
And then I'll let the darkness cover me
Deny everything
Slowly walk away
To breathe again
On my own

Carry me away
I need your strength to get me through this

Dare to believe
Oh, for one last time
And then I'll let the darkness cover me
Deny everything
Slowly walk away
To breathe again
On my own
On my own
On my own
On my own
On my own

Dare to believe
Oh, for one last time
And then I'll let the darkness cover me
Deny everything
Slowly walk away
To breathe again
On my own
On my own
