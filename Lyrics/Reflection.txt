I have come curiously close to the end, now
Beneath my self-indulgent, pitiful hole

Defeated, I concede and
Move closer
I may find comfort here
I may find peace within the emptiness, how pitiful

And it's calling me...
It's calling me...
It's calling me...
It's calling me...

And in my darkest moment, fetal and weeping
The moon tells me a secret, her confidant
As full and bright as I am
This light is not my own and
A million light reflections pass over me
The source is bright and endless
She rescusitates the hopeless
Without her we are lifeless satellites drifting

And as I pull my head out I am without one doubt
Don't wanna be down here serving my narcissism
I must crucify the ego before it's far too late
I pray the light lifts me out

Before I pine away...
Before I pine away...
Before I pine away...
Before I pine away...

So crucify the ego, before it's far too late
And leave behind this place so negative and blind and cynical
And you will come to find that we are all one mind
And capable of all that's imagined and unconceivable
So let the light touch you, so let the words spill through
And let them pass right through
Bringing out our hope and reason

Before we pine away...
Before we pine away...
Before we pine away...
Before we pine away...
