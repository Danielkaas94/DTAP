On the rebound, on the rebound
That's how you fell for me
That's how you changed my life
You cut me like a knife

On the rebound, on the rebound
You came, you saw, you took
It only took one look
And lady, I was hooked

On the rebound, it's a replay
On the rebound, it's a replay
On the rebound, it's a replay

Your love was on the rebound
On the rebound, you came and took my soul
You came and left a hole
Where your love used to be

On the rebound, on the rebound
You like to drown in your tears
And after all these years
You give your pain to me

On the rebound, you came to me, babe
On the rebound, to set you free
On the rebound, too bad for me

Your love was on the rebound

On the rebound, it's a replay
On the rebound, it's a replay
On the rebound, it's a replay
On the rebound

On the rebound, you came to me
On the rebound, to set you free
On the rebound, too bad for me
On the rebound

On the rebound, it's a replay
On the rebound, you came to me, babe
On the rebound, it's a replay
On the rebound, to set you free

On the rebound, just a replay
On the rebound, your love was
On the rebound, just a replay
On the rebound, your love was

On the rebound, replay
On the rebound, on the rebound
