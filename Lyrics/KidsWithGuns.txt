Kids with guns
Taking over
But they won't be long
They're mesmerized
Skeletons

Kids with guns
Kids with guns
Easy does it, easy does it, they've got something to say "no" to

Drinking out (push it real)
Pacifier (push it real, push it)
Vitamin souls (push it, push it real)
The street desire (push it real, push it)
Doesn't make sense to (push it, push it real)
But it won't be long (push it real, push it)

Kids with guns
Kids with guns
Easy does it, easy does it, they've got something to say "no" to

Now they're turning us into monsters
Turning us into fire
Turning us into monsters
It's all desire
It's all desire
It's all desire

Drinking out
Pacifier
Sinking souls
There you are
Doesn't make sense to
But it won't be long

'Cause kids with guns
Kids with guns
Easy does it, easy does it, they've got something to say "no" to

Now they're turning us into monsters
Turning us into fire
Turning us into monsters
It's all desire
It's all desire
It's all desire
