Yeah, she was built with a brain and some swagger
A little scream, little cry, little laughter
She's a ten, I'm a joke in my own mind
But she still loves to dance with my punch lines

This love found us
Now I see it
This love up down
Please believe

Baby, when I'm yellin' at you
It's not your fault
It's not your fault, yeah
And baby 'cause I'm crazy for you
It's not your fault
It's not your fault, yeah
And baby I'm a little confused
It's not your fault
It's not your fault, yeah
And baby, it's a wonderful news
It's not your fault
It's not your fault, yeah

Oh, it's not that you should care
I just wanted you to know

I'm a fight with myself 'til I'm bleeding
Just a taste of your skin starts the healing
Anyone from my past get your ammo
Find my sun in the dark side of my shadow

This love found us
Now I see it
This love up down
Please believe

Baby, when I'm yellin' at you
It's not your fault
It's not your fault, yeah
And baby 'cause I'm crazy for you
It's not your fault
It's not your fault, yeah
And maybe I'm a little confused
It's not your fault
It's not your fault, yeah
And baby, it's a wonderful news
It's not your fault
It's not your fault, yeah

Oh, it's not that you should care
I just wanted you to know
