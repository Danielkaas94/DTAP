I'm not the way that you found me
I'm neither here nor there
One day I'm happy and healthy
Next I ain't doing so well

Let's go walk to the border
Let's go walk along the inch
Let's go when no one can see us
And find the difference between us

You can cry like a baby
Just let me do what I need to
It might be to me or to you
Just let me do what I need to

I'm not the way that you found me
I'm neither here nor there
One day I'm happy and healthy
Next I ain't doing so well

Let's go walk to the border
Let's go walk along the inch
Let's go when no one can see us
And find the difference between us

I'm not the way that you found me
I'm neither here nor there
One day I'm happy and healthy
Next I ain't doing so well

Let's go walk to the border
Let's go walk along the inch
Let's go when no one can see us
And find the difference between us

You can cry like a baby
Just let me do what I need to
It might be to me or to you
Just let me do what I need to

I'm not the way that you found me
I'm neither here nor there
One day I'm happy and healthy
Next I ain't doing so well
