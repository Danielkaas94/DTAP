Help me, I've fallen on the inside
I tried to change the game
I tried to infiltrate, but now I'm losing
Men in cloaks always seem to run the show

Save me from the ghosts and shadows
Before they eat my soul, yeah

Mercy
Mercy
Show me mercy
From the powers that be
Show me mercy
Can someone rescue me?

Absent gods and silent tyranny
We're going under
Hypnotized by another puppeteer
And tell me why the men in cloaks
Always have to bring me down
Running from the ghosts and shadows
The world just disavows, yeah

Mercy
Mercy
Show me mercy
From the powers that be
Show me mercy
Can someone rescue me?

Show me mercy
Show me mercy, please

Help me, I've fallen on the inside
And all the men in cloaks trying to devour my soul
Show me mercy
From the powers that be
Show me mercy
From the gutless and mean
Show me mercy
From the killing machines
Show me mercy
Can someone rescue me?
