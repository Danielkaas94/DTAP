What is that incessant humming
Coming from your manga maw?
Oh, you breathe twin towers
Oh, you gave your powers up

And I can't teach you how to stop it
And you can't make me understand
Break the withered habit
Oh, I need your rabid smile

Your home (with the family wife and child and wife and)
Your head (days in the cemetery come, the calm, the calm, the)
Take form (as your figure becomes the stone, the stone, your)
Your first body, last body

I wish the summer was over us in bursts
We're in the middle of nothing we can hold
And the sewers erupting life in gold
I'm gonna happen and happen until my whole gave up the ghost
I'm gonna renew my sinew until my cells divide no more

So lean me up and take a picture
I can't move my legs and arms
It's too much information, too much to be thinking of
And each of us have separate houses
And each of us have separate souls
And some of us do nothing
Some, some of us do nothing more

Your home (sleep as your figure becomes the stone, the stone, the)
Your head (time with the family, sleep the wheel, the tomb, the)
Take form (dance with the atrophy cold, and warm, and warm, your)
Your first body, last body

I wish the cesspit would open like a bible
I wish the rotten would blossom with the tidal
And I've never been able to divide us
I'm gonna wrestle and wrangle until my legs become unreal
I'm gonna stumble and scramble my way to lactic ecstasy

While I can slumber, rest, move so slowly
It's creeping across his chest, like some cold weed
He's not as afraid as me, like some dancer

My home
My head
Take form

I wish the cesspit would open like a bible
I wish the rotten would blossom with the tidal
And I've never been able to divide us
I'm gonna wrestle and wrangle until my legs become unreal
I'm gonna stumble and scramble my way to lactic ecstasy

I wish the summer was over us in bursts
We're in the middle of nothing we can hold
And the sewers erupting life in gold
I'm gonna happen and happen until my whole give up the ghost
I'm gonna renew my sinew until my cells divide no more

Stood in a mirror
It's hard
(My lifestyle determines my death style, amen)
