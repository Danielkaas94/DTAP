Listen to the rain fallin' day by day
Listen to the rain fallin' day by day by day
Hey

I hear you calling, voices are here again
I hear you whisper, taking control of me
Watch the dancing shadows run away
All alone once again, afraid

All these faces, changing their shapes on me
Isolated in my own world, will it ever be free?
Haunted figures around me, I want em' to stay
There always there to protect me, this is one thing you can't take away

Listen to the rain fallin' day by day
Listen to the rain fallin' day by day by day
Yeah!

I hear you calling, voices are here again
I hear you whisper in my own mind, will it ever change?
Voices
Voices
Voices
Voices

I hear you calling
