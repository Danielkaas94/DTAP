I'm wondering why your face no longer shines
I'm wondering why your face no longer shines
I'm wondering why you're always on my mind
I'm stll wondering, give me a little more time

I need to know why I can't see your tears
I need to know why I can't see your tears
I need to know how many lonesome years
I want to make you cast away your fears

I'm wondering why your face no longer shines
I'm wondering why your face no longer shines
I'm wondering why you're always on my mind
I'm stll wondering, give me a little more time
