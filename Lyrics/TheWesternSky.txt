Isn’t it a strange world?
With you and me
Gazing at each other
Through a misty scene of a part of me

Dreaming of the green hills
But we could fly
Listening to the night bird
That made us cry with its lullaby

But we’ll overcome
And stand on the heights
And we’ll be together
In our dreams

As we look around us
The world goes on
We’re strangers in a strange land
Tryna find where we don’t belong

Shadows in the darkness
Just passing through
(Just passing through)
Now that I have found you
I realize what I got to do
(I realize what I got to do)

[Repeat x2]
But we’ll overcome
And stand on the heights
And we’ll be together
In the end

Out on the horizon
The west wind sighs
(The west wind sighs)
A beautiful adventure
Waiting there in the western sky
(Waiting there in the western sky)

Bring me some redemption
Take me home
(Take me home)
Take me where my heart lies
Now I know that I’m not alone

But we’ll overcome
And stand on the heights
And we’ll be together
In our dreams

In the end
In our dreams
(In our dreams, in the end)
(In our dreams)
In the end
(In the end, in our dreams, in the end)
