Don't throw it all away
Hear what I've gotta say
Because you're always on my mind
I've got an eye on you
And only you will do
And I don't wanna waste my time

So won't you hear me out
Because It's all about when
I come home again to you

You're such a little child
You're gonna drive me wild
As I just don't know what to say
I got an eye on you
And only you will do
And I don't wanna get in your play

Hesitate, because I cannot wait
Till I come home again to you

You make me feel so old
Just like I have been told
Because it's always up to you
Oh baby, hear me out
I've done all my time
I don't wanna be misused

So please don't hesitate
Because I cannot wait
Till I come home again to you

Home to you
