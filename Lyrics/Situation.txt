Lying in my sweat drying my tears,
Waiting for you I am...
Making me feel like I don't care.
I don't care, yeah!

This situation in my head (head, head)
Will this situation ever end? (end, end)

How can I feel if I can't breathe,
What we once had will never be again.

This situation in my head (head, head)
Will this situation ever end? (end, end)

And I cannot take it anymore!

I really like what you can give me but I don't know where I'm standing right now, not yet...
And I really think that you can hear me, why you're not turning this around?
I'll never know, I'll never know, I said I'll never know!
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Never, never, never, never, never, never, never, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah!!
