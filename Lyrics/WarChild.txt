Open your eyes, you're still here
Still safe, at peace in this world
So great, you're free
You don't have to fight for your life
But just say, just say
There's fire from the sky
And you're burning alive

Why all this pain and
Poison in her mind
What can you change
When hatred made her blind soldiers
No reason to look into her eyes
No one to hold her
No one who really cares

Lifeless expressions
Destroyed all conceptions
For children in the street
Who's there to help you
When all is forgotten and
Torn apart by fear
No one to hold her
No one who really cares

Oh please don't cry
Oh no war child

The struggle for power
That grows by the hour
Like the blood beneath her feet
Dispering with heartache
There must be somebody
To help her in such need
No one to hold her
No one who really cares

Open your eyes, you're still here
Still safe, at peace in this world
So great, you're free
You don't have to fight for your life
War child
