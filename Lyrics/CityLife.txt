Wake up
Wake up
Wake up
Signs tell the time you're wasting

Wake up
Wake up
Wake up
Life you will find is changing

Oh, the city life
Endless confusion
Hanging on too tight
To this illusion

I'm not what I appear to be
I couldn't take the honesty
It seemed to be
Too easy for reality

Oh, the city life
What have I come to?
Faces in the night
Friendly to fool you

I always try to justify
The way I am
And wonder why
I couldn't be
The same to you I am to me

Wake up
Wake up
Wake up
Wake up
Wake up

I'm not what I appear to be
I couldn't take the honesty
It seemed to be
Too easy for reality

Oh, the city life

Brings you up
Lets you down

Oh, the city life
City life
