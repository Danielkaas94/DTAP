We flow with bitter words, sharp our teeth
We bite off our own tongues
We trample any trace of your divinity's hope
We'll sacrifice our young

With our eyes sewn shut, now the light can't shine
We'll never wake from dead
When you beg for us to open up and let you in
We'll cut you out instead

You promised, you'd give us your word
We never believed it was true
And we pretend that we never heard
'Cause we still don't believe in you

I heard you calling, setting fire to my soul
Is this the voice we die for? We die for life

We built a wall to keep you out
Ignoring every word
And we saw your face behind our thoughts
Apathetic to what we'd heard

You promised, you'd give us your word
We never believed it was true
And we pretend that we never heard
'Cause we still don't believe in you

I heard you calling, setting fire to my soul
Is this the voice we die for? We die for life
I heard you calling, setting fire to my soul
Is this the voice we die for? We die for life

Why does it falter? We built it all ourselves
Why does it hurt so bad, forsaking all this help?
Why are we choking on pills designed to heal?
And we threw our hearts away 'cause we're too afraid
Too afraid to feel

I heard you calling, setting fire to my soul
Is this the voice we die for? We die for life
I heard you calling, setting fire to my soul
Is this the voice we die for?
