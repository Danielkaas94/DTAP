Who are you to wave your finger?
You must have been outta your head
Eye hole deep in muddy waters
You practically raised the dead

Rob the grave to snow the cradle
Then burn the evidence down
Soapbox house of cards and glass so
Don't go tossin' your stones around

You must have been high
You must have been high
You must have been

Foot in mouth and head up ass-hole
Whatcha talkin' 'bout?
Difficult to dance 'round this one
'Til you pull it out, boy
You must have been so high

You must have been so high
Steal, borrow, refer, save your shady inference

Kangaroo done hung the juror with the innocent
Now you're weeping shades of cozened indigo

Got lemon juice up in your eye
When you pissed all over my black kettle
You must have been high-high
You must have been high-high
Who are you to wave your finger?
So full of it
Eyeballs deep in muddy waters
Fuckin' hypocrite
Liar, lawyer; mirror show me, what's the difference?
Kangaroo done hung the guilty with the innocent

Now you're weeping shades of cozened indigo
Got lemon juice up in your eye, eye
When you pissed all over my black kettle
You must've been-

So who are you to wave your finger?
Who are you to wave your fatty fingers at me?

You must have been out your mind
Weepin' shades of indigo
Trapped without a reason
Weepin' shades of indigo
Liar, lawyer; mirror for ya', what's the difference?
Kangaroo be stoned. He's guilty as the government

Now you're weeping shades of cozened indigo
Got lemon juice up in your eye, eye
Now when you pissed all over my black kettle
You must've been
High
High
High
High
Eyeballs deep in muddy waters
Your balls deep in muddy waters
Ganja, please
You must have been out your mind
