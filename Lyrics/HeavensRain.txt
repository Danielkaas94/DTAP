I look back on those days
At the permanent haze
And the dark that surrounded me
Then good fortune arrived
I saw life in your eyes
You talked about changing views
Freedom to choose, darkness to light

There lies the kingdom
Of beautiful stories
Pure as the heaven's rain
Shine on the heartache
The bittersweet glory
Shine over everyone

Down the road I would fall
The wrong side of the wall
Sound of madness
Moved in for the kill
Then good fortune arrived
I saw life in your eyes
You talked about taking me
To a place I should know
Just you and me

There's a hole in the sun
Where I wanted to run
There were clouds in the open sea
Then good fortune arrived
I saw life in your eyes
You talked about showing me
A place I should know
Just you and me

Shine over everyone...
