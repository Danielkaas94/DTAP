And I wonder day to day
I don't like you anyway
I don't need your shit today
You're pathetic in your own way

I feel for you
Better fuckin' go away
I will behave
Better fuckin' go away

I'm doin' the best I ever did
I'm doin' the best that I can
I'm doin' the best I ever did

I don't need to fantasize
You are my pet all the time
I don't mind if you go blind
You get what you get
Until you're through with mine

I feel for you
Better fuckin' go away
I will behave
You better go away

I feel for you
Better fuckin' go away
I will behave
You better go away

I'm doin' the best I ever did
I'm doin' the best that I can
I'm doin' the best I ever did
Now go away

I'm doin' the best I ever did
I'm doin' the best that I can
I'm doin' the best I ever did
Now go away

I'm doin' the best I ever did
Go away
I'm doin' the best that I can
Go away

I'm doin' the best I ever did
Go away
I'm doin' the best that I can
Go away
I'm doin' the best I ever did
I'm doin' the best that I can
I'm doin' the best I ever did
Now go away

I'm doin' the best I ever did
I'm doin' the best that I can
I'm doin' the best I ever did
Now go away
I'm doin' the best I ever did
I'm doin' the best that I can
I'm doin' the best I ever did
Now go away
I'm doin' the best I ever did
Go away
I'm doin' the best that I can
