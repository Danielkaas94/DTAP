Once upon a time at the foot of a great mountain
There was a town where the people known as Happyfolk lived

Their very existence a mystery to the rest of the world
Obscured as it was by great clouds
Here they played out their peaceful lives
Innocent of the litany of excess and violence

That was growing in the world below

To live in harmony with

The spirit of the mountain called Monkey was enough

Then one day Strangefolk arrived in the town
They came in camouflaged

Hidden behind dark glasses and no one noticed them
They only saw shadows
You see without the truth of the eyes
The Happyfolk were blind

Falling out of aeroplanes and hiding out in holes
Waiting for the sunset to come people going home
Jump out from behind them and shoot them in the head
Now everybody dancing
The dance of the dead
The dance of the dead
The dance of the dead

In time Strangefolk found their way
Into the higher reaches of the mountain
And it was there that they found the caves
Of unimaginable sincerity and beauty
By chance they stumbled upon
The place where all good souls come to rest

The Strangefolk they coveted
The jewels in these caves above all things
And soon they began to mine the mountain
It's rich seam fueling the chaos of their own world

Meanwhile down in the town
The Happyfolk slept restlessly their dreams Invaded by shadowy figures
Digging away at their souls
Every day people would wake and stare at the mountain
Why was it bringing darkness into their lives?

And as the Strangefolk mined deeper and deeper into the mountain
Holes began to appear
Bringing with them a cold and bitter wind
That chilled the very soul of the Monkey
For the first time the Happyfolk felt fearful for
They knew that soon the Monkey would stir from it's deep sleep
Then there came a sound
Distant first it grew into castrophany
So immense that it could be heard far away in space
There were no screams there was no time
The mountain called Monkey had spoken
There was only fire
And then nothing

Oh a little town in the USA
The time has come to see
There's nothing you believe you are
But where were you when it all came down on me?
Did you call me? no
