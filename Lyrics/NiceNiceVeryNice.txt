Oh a sleeping drunkard up in Central Park
Or the lion hunter in the jungle dark

Or the Chinese dentist or the British Queen
They all fit together in the same machine

Nice, nice, very nice
Nice, nice, very nice
So many people in the same device

Oh a whirling dervish and a dancing bear
Or a Ginger Rogers and a Fred Astaire

Or a teenage rocker or the girls in France
Yes, we all are partners in this cosmic dance

Nice, nice, very nice
Nice, nice, very nice
So many people in the same device

I wanted all things to make sense
So we'd be happy instead of tense

Oh a sleeping drunkard up in Central Park
Or the lion hunter in the jungle dark

Or the Chinese dentist or the British Queen
They all fit together in the same machine

Nice, nice, very nice
Nice, nice, very nice
So many people in the same device
So many people in the same device
