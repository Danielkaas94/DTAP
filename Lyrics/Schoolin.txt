Brother, you look like the Taj Mahal
One colossal dome above you and the smell of something other
A pillar and a scimitar, a little
Yes, I miss you like a formless hide
Stretching over me and dangled from the coastguard in a chopper
The scaffold of me all awry, you little

Broke your shoulder on the library steps
Hanging 'round there in the dark just doing nothing or whatever
What do you mean you saw the stars? You little
And I could write it in a murder font
I could say it in a way that would be lying or whatever
I don't want them to tell us apart

You say that I'm an overlord?
I've got myself a fire hydrant with more tyrant
In watery blasts than all of my past
You seen me on the bridge a lot
But I never leapt over the pent upper
My number is up, my number is up

But infinite and joyless little high fives are singing, "Praise the lord"
And, "Pitter-patter this schooling? Is this schooling?"
And, "You matter not" and, "You matter not"
And is it the flogging of a Flintstone that I'm supposed to be?
The cerebellum gets schooling and no schooling
The drummer goes on, the drama goes on

(Teach me how to hold)

And I wouldn't wanna make a scene
I don't wanna think about the third-world hunger or whatever
'Cause thinking always comes across a little
And there's a meeting of the worlds tonight
Right above my head, a miracle, the sun erupt forever
I barely ever raise my eyes, a little (teach him how to hold)

And oh, I wanna make the peace
And God, I gotta be on the train past the ruins
The wall and the druids, oh, please
I'm whining like a braking bus
Maybe, I can sit here and do nothing clever with a laser
I'm not about to open up

You say that I'm an overlord?
I've got myself a fire hydrant with more tyrant
In watery blasts than all of my past
You seen me on the bridge a lot
But I never leapt over the pent upper
My number is up, my number is up

But infinite and joyless little high fives are singing, "Praise the lord"
And, "Pitter-patter this schooling? Is this schooling?"
And, "You matter not" and, "You matter not"
And is it the flogging of a Flintstone that I'm supposed to be?
The cerebellum gets schooling and no schooling
The drummer goes on, the drama goes on
The drummer goes on, the drama goes on
My number is up, my number is up

(There's a matter approaching)
(There's a matter approaching)

Earth, I take a long time
To learn about the big one
Gorilla limb swipe and beat
And I learnt nil about Earth
Remember how men
Would understand the heavens?
But leaving those streetlights on
You can't see nothing there

(There's a matter approaching)
So learn me anything good
(There's a matter approaching)
And teach me something that works

I take a long time
To learn about the big one
Gorilla limb swipe and beat
And I learnt dick about Earth
Remember good men
Would understand the heavens?
And leaving those streetlights on
A ghost dark hemisphere Earth

I take a long time
To learn about the big one
Gorilla limb swipe and beat
And I learnt dick about Earth
Remember, good man
You understand the heavens
But leaving those streetlights on?
