# 12+ brutal truths for employers


1. When your best people leave, it's not them. It's you.  
2. You don't have a remote work issue. You have trust issues.  
3. Management that can't handle feedback won't survive change.  
4. If your actions don't align with your values, your employees won't trust you.  
5. Your diversity program is hollow if your leadership team all looks the same.  
6. Underpaying your people doesn't make you cost-effective. It makes you short-sighted.  
7. A toxic culture will tarnish your brand, no matter how good your products are.  
8. The customer experience will never exceed the employee experience.  
9. Micromanagement isn't a sign of dedication, it's a warning sign.  
10. Top talent won't stay if their growth isn't your priority.  
11. Leading by fear creates teams that underperform.  
12. If you don't pay people what they're worth, someone else will.  
  
When you always put your people first,  
they'll give you their best  
and everyone wins.
  
Agree? Repost for your network too ♻️. Thanks!  
  
P.S. What's a brutal truth you'd add?

## 📌 BONUS BRUTAL TRUTHS  
  
Let's keep the list going. What would you add? I'll start:  
  
13. Employee loyalty is earned, not entitled.  
14. An open-door policy means nothing if your mind is closed.  
15. Promoting bad managers is the quickest way to lose good employees.  
16. Respect, recognition, and fair treatment are mandatory. It's not up for debate.  
17. Calling your company a "family" and then issuing pink slips is betrayal, not leadership.
---
18. When it comes to decision making, listen to your team’s suggestions first, ask their opinion. They are the ones who know that field and tasks better than you.  
19. Every day/week invite a different employee, team member for a lunch and ask them what they would do better, differently when it comes to improving things.
---
20. Respect dignity and purpose. The only why to treat yer colleagues. People don’t work for you (they work for themselves, their families, belief’s, values), they work with you.  
21. If planet is not your priority: you will not survive.
---
24. People are not stupid. Actually, the are smarter than you or your team sucks.
25. Remember the three most important words in business: I don't know. If you know, you don't. Ask.
26. You have two ears and one mouth to listen more and talk less
27. You are a bad actor. People will see if you are faking. Admit the truth rather than conceal it.
28. There is no negative feedback under positive intentions
29. People are not an asset. They are partners.
---
31. Team leaders may evaluate their team members' performance. The performance of team leaders and "above" must be evaluated bottom-up at least 50%. Everything above are working for their employees. If you don't accept that, you're the problem.
32. Self-perceived and centered messaging by managers is ignorant or neurotic at best, narcissistic at worst. Company communication should be grassroots work. Everything else is just detached from reality.
33. If you don't make time for your employees, your employees won't make time for you
34. Any critical feedback is worth 1000 times the amount. Imagine for anyone providing feedback, there's 999 people just sucking everything up. The true ratios are probably even thinner.
35. your culture can only be as good as the worst behavior that you tolerate.
36. If you hand out promotions solely based on the expertise of peoples work, you're going to lose the best qualified people in the field. Imagine someone promoted with less knowledgeable skills, but very high leadership skills - said no one ever. that's also your problem.
37. you may lead by (just) proclaiming your ways. It does not mean jack s#17, as long you're not leading by example. You'll be seen as the hipocrite that you are.

### Additional thoughts:  
2. You don't have a remote work issue. You have trust issues. - Numerous studies clearly indicate that engagement was at an all time high when remote work became more prominent, retention was higher, and performance was trending upwards.  
  
3. Management that can't handle feedback won't survive change. - This is a MAJOR red flag! If a manager is encouraged to give feedback (constructive or otherwise), there needs to be a clear standard set that employees are in a safe space to provide feedback to their manager as well. When upward feedback is given, it's often ignored or ends up putting a "target" on an employee's back.  
  
5. Your diversity program is hollow if your leadership team all looks the same. This AND if you have set goals in place for diversifying your organization and "supporting" inclusion initiatives, apply some budget to those efforts. Don't hire a DEI team if you aren't willing to make a real investment in their success.  
  
10. Top talent won't stay if their growth isn't your priority - There is a lot of talk about "owning your own professional development" which has some truths, but more often than not is a means for a manager to skirt due responsibility.

<summary>Work-life balance is a myth. There's just life</summary>


> Credits: Dan Murray-Serter


Work-life balance is a myth. There's just life. 5 ways to take back control of it at work:

𝗪𝗵𝘆?

Burnout.

When work overpowers life, you burnout.

Burnout leads to:

- Lower productivity
- Lack of creativity
- Decreased happiness
- Poor health

Simply put, no balance = no good.

How?

### 𝟭) 𝗦𝗲𝘁 𝗯𝗼𝘂𝗻𝗱𝗮𝗿𝗶𝗲𝘀.

Don't let work creep into your personal time.

Set clear expectations for yourself and your boss/team.

- No checking emails after work hours
- No taking home work
- Dedicate time for personal activities

Protecting your time is the first step towards balance.

### 𝟮) 𝗣𝗿𝗶𝗼𝗿𝗶𝘁𝗶𝘇𝗲 𝘁𝗮𝘀𝗸𝘀.

Not all tasks are created equal.

Ask yourself:

- Does this task have a deadline?
- Will it have a significant impact?
- Can someone else do it?

Prioritize based on importance and urgency.

### 𝟯) 𝗧𝗮𝗸𝗲 𝗯𝗿𝗲𝗮𝗸𝘀.

Breaks give your mind and body a chance to recharge.

Take small breaks throughout the day to:

- Stretch
- Walk
- Meditate
- Listen to music

Take long breaks to:

- Take a vacation
- Spend time with loved ones
- Learn something new

### 𝟰) 𝗟𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻 𝘁𝗼 𝘀𝗮𝘆 𝗻𝗼.

Saying yes to everything leads to an overwhelmed life.

Learn to say no to:

- Nonessential tasks
- Demands on your time
- Activities that don't align with your values/goals

### 𝟱) 𝗖𝗿𝗲𝗮𝘁𝗲 𝗮 𝗿𝗼𝘂𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗲.

Consistency is key.

Create a routine that works for you:

- Wake up at the same time every day
- Dedicate time for work and personal activities
- End work at the same time every day
- Set aside time for self-care

A routine helps you create structure and carve out time for what's important.

𝗕𝗮𝗹𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲 𝗶𝘀 𝗰𝗿𝘂𝗰𝗶𝗮𝗹 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝗮 𝗳𝘂𝗹𝗳𝗶𝗹𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗹𝗶𝗳𝗲.

Protect your time, prioritize tasks, take breaks, learn to say no, and create a routine.

Reassess regularly and adjust as needed.

Life is too short to trade away balance.
