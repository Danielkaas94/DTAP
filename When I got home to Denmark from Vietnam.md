*Date: 27th September 2025*

I just got back to Denmark from a trip to Vietnam. I was exhausted, sick with a sore throat, low on energy and all I wanted was to come home, see the living room again, sit at my PC, take a hot shower and go to bed in my old bedroom. Instead of being welcomed I was met with rejection.

My father expected me to bring him a burger without ever telling me. When I said I was too tired and not in the mood for that today, he told me I was not allowed inside the house. No food, no shower, not even use of the toilet. Just because of a burger. This is how he treats his son after a long journey.

I have sacrificed years of my life helping my parents. I have collected groceries for them since they do not have a car. I have helped with rent and bills. I have put my own needs aside to care for them. In return I have been belittled, manipulated and treated as if I am not really part of the family. My father acts like a spiritual narcissist. My mother is a skilled manipulator who has tried to pressure me into buying a share of a house that is falling apart. My siblings are no better and I have already cut them out of my life.

At 31 I realize I have been playing the role of the adult while my parents behave like children. I have given and given and it has never been enough. What happened when I came home this time was the final straw. I am done.

I will no longer sacrifice myself for people who treat me like a stranger in my own family. I will no longer waste my energy on trying to earn basic respect and love from people who cannot give it. This chapter is closed.

It is time to find my own place in this world. A place where I can build my own life on my own terms. A place where I am not shamed for my choices or manipulated for money. A place where I can finally live instead of being trapped in the toxic cycle of my family.

To anyone who has gone through something similar, know that you are not alone. Choosing yourself is not selfish. It is survival.

# Update: The Apology

Hi Dad.

I'm not writing to start another argument. I've been thinking a lot about what happened when I got home from Vietnam, and I can see that I reacted violently. I was sick, exhausted, and emotionally drained after a 36-hour trip. Being met with rejection and humiliation at that point ignited something in me that I could no longer suppress. I apologize for that.

I had really been looking forward to coming home. To see the living room again, to greet you, to hug our dog Santa, to take a hot shower, to use a proper toilet, to sit at my computer, and finally to sleep in my old bedroom. I longed for peace, recognition, and security. Instead, I was met with distrust, anger, and demands that I should have anticipated your wishes without you even saying anything.

But let's be honest. This isn't about a burger. This is about years and years of constantly dominating, controlling, and determining everything. And when someone sets a limit, you get angry, offended, and upset. It‚Äôs always been that way, and I‚Äôm tired of it. You can call it what you want, but it‚Äôs not love, it‚Äôs power.

I‚Äôve been the most loyal of your children, and yet I‚Äôm the one you talk down to the most.

I‚Äôve forgiven you for many things, including the episode where you tried to pull the steering wheel of my car while I was driving because you were angry that we got out of Ringk√∏bing a few seconds later because we didn‚Äôt take the ‚Äúshortcut‚Äù through the pedestrian zone. It wasn‚Äôt just dangerous, it was deeply disturbing. You‚Äôd rather risk an accident, maybe even die, than accept coming home five seconds later to your TV and your tobacco. That says everything about how extreme your need for control has become.

If I had brought you a burger after a 36-hour journey, there wouldn‚Äôt have been any conflict at all. You could have asked me what the mood was for dinner. Whether it was a burger, a wiener schnitzel or just a beer. Instead, the only response I got on my entire journey from Copenhagen to West Jutland was an ‚ÄúOkay üëç‚Äù.

I‚Äôm not writing this to hurt you, but to set a boundary. I‚Äôm done putting up with being talked to like a child who owes you something. I don‚Äôt owe you anything anymore. I‚Äôve paid my dues many times over.

I hope you understand that I‚Äôm not writing this out of anger, but out of clarification. I don‚Äôt want to be part of your power games anymore. I want peace. If you need to tell yourself that you‚Äôre the victim in this, do it. It doesn‚Äôt change anything for me anymore.

I take responsibility for my own reaction, but I no longer take responsibility for your reality.

‚Äì Daniel
