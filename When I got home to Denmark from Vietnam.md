*Date: 27th September 2025*

I just got back to Denmark from a trip to Vietnam. I was exhausted, sick with a sore throat, low on energy and all I wanted was to come home, see the living room again, sit at my PC, take a hot shower and go to bed in my old bedroom. Instead of being welcomed I was met with rejection.

My father expected me to bring him a burger without ever telling me. When I said I was too tired and not in the mood for that today, he told me I was not allowed inside the house. No food, no shower, not even use of the toilet. Just because of a burger. This is how he treats his son after a long journey.

I have sacrificed years of my life helping my parents. I have collected groceries for them since they do not have a car. I have helped with rent and bills. I have put my own needs aside to care for them. In return I have been belittled, manipulated and treated as if I am not really part of the family. My father acts like a spiritual narcissist. My mother is a skilled manipulator who has tried to pressure me into buying a share of a house that is falling apart. My siblings are no better and I have already cut them out of my life.

At 31 I realize I have been playing the role of the adult while my parents behave like children. I have given and given and it has never been enough. What happened when I came home this time was the final straw. I am done.

I will no longer sacrifice myself for people who treat me like a stranger in my own family. I will no longer waste my energy on trying to earn basic respect and love from people who cannot give it. This chapter is closed.

It is time to find my own place in this world. A place where I can build my own life on my own terms. A place where I am not shamed for my choices or manipulated for money. A place where I can finally live instead of being trapped in the toxic cycle of my family.

To anyone who has gone through something similar, know that you are not alone. Choosing yourself is not selfish. It is survival.
